<p><b>Read the passage below. It contains blank spaces numbered 1 to 15. For each blank space, choose the best alternative from the choices given.</b></p>
<p>I think that time has ______1  in our lives when we cannot do without the computer. With the computer, we ______2 do almost everything especially with regard ______3 typing. </p>
<p>One advantage of using the computer is that we can ______4 parts of typed work, such as paragraphs, from one section of ______5 document to another. When using a typewriter we would have to ______6 away with the unwanted sections, then type all over again. </p>
<p>Another advantage of using the computer is that we can preserve and store information. ______7 information can be retrieved more easily than when it is filed. Imagine being able to get your work at the touch of a ______8 without having to go through volumes ______9 volumes of books. With the computer, one can find work that was typed as long ago as ten years without much struggle. </p>
<p>The computer is also fun to work ______10 as it can provide many ______11 of entertainment. For example, it can be used to play music as well as a ______12 variety of games. We can also watch movies from a computer. In  addition, a computer that is connected to the internet can provide ______13 to a lot of information. ______14 the computer has made life ______15 easy and interesting that I cannot imagine life without it.</p>

<b>Read the passage below and then answer questions 26 to 38. </b>
<p>I had never felt so nervous in my life. As I stood outside the hall waiting for my turn to go on stage and recite my poem, discouraging thoughts crossed my mind. I had been told that it was extremely difficult to win at this level of the competition. I had heard that adjudicators usually favoured participants from schools with a history of winning, and that it was almost impossible for a first-timer like me to emerge victorious. Indeed, it was rumoured that if the judge did not know you or your school, you stood little chance of winning. </p>
<p>Now here I was. Neither my school nor I had taken part in the festival before. I was representing my county in this competition, whose winner would proceed to the national level. My poem was entitled “Conquer the Monster”. It was about the evils of corruption and favouritism. </p>
<p>“All those waiting to recite poems should now line up outside the entrance to the stage,” came the emcee’s voice over the loudspeaker. “If you fail to appear when your name is called, you will have yourself to blame.” </p>
<p>Mr. Gali, my teacher, came to me, held me by the hand and led me to the entrance where I joined the queue. There were only three people in front of me. </p>
<p>“... And thereafter, Lydia shall present her poem ‘Conquer the Monster’.” When I heard my name I almost fainted. I felt weak in the knees, my eyes felt moist and then all of a sudden, I wanted to use the toilet. I looked around and saw a block of toilets nearby labelled “Staff Only.” Luckily, the toilets were not locked.</p> 
<p>No sooner was I inside one of the toilets than I heard the emcee announce that there was going to be a short break. Quick thinking told me that some staff members were likely to visit these toilets. Determined not to be found out, I firmly locked the door of the toilet in which I was. And sure enough, I soon heard two men talking as they approached the toilets. </p>
<p>“I wonder what is happening in this festival,” one of them said. </p>
<p>“Sure,” said the other “I am yet to see a confident performer since the festival began. In fact, I have never adjudicated at a more boring festival.” What? So these were the adjudicators! I now listened to them more keenly. “Most of the performers appear to lack confidence and are unsure of their lines,” continued the second man. That was music to my ears. All the nervousness melted away in a second. </p>
<p>To my relief, these people did not stay in the toilets for long. As soon as they had left, I opened the door, rushed out and resumed my position on the queue. When I went on stage, I recited my poem as if my life depended on it. Needless to say, I got the first position.</p>

<p class = "questions">26. Why was the writer feeling nervous?</p>

<b>Read the following passage and then answer questions 39 to 50.</b>
<p>Population control has become a burning issue in developing countries. Most countries realise that if they became overpopulated, the consequences will be grave. It is obvious that even within the family set-up, having many children becomes more of a problem than a blessing. In Kenya, the government, the church and individuals have always stressed the need to have a population that we can easily manage. This is because the negative effects of overpopulation are far-reaching. </p>
<p>For a country that relies on agriculture for its economic growth, the issue of land is crucial. If there is overpopulation, there will not be enough land for people to cultivate. They will therefore start cultivating the marginal lands and this could lead to the spread of deserts. Lack of enough land for farming will also lead to shortage of food, resulting in starvation and illnesses like marasmus and kwashiorkor. </p>
<p>In addition, scarcity of land may force people to move from rural to urban areas in  search of alternative means of earning a living. With these migrations, towns become so overcrowded that people are forced to live in slums. The conditions in these areas are a health hazard. When people fail to get jobs, they become frustrated and some may turn to crime. </p>
<p>Furthermore, overpopulation causes strain on resources in the education sector. When the number of children bom every year continues to grow, classrooms become congested and there aren’t enough teachers. This affects the academic performance of the pupils. </p>
<p>Moreover, a country with a high population finds it difficult to cope with the health problems of its people. The medical facilities will not be adequate. This means that the sick will not be attended to in time, infant mortality will be high, and the life expectancy will be low. </p>
<p>The problem of overpopulation also has a great effect on individuals even at the family level. A family that has many children often finds it difficult to feed, clothe and educate them. The parents usually blame each other for their problems and in the long run, this may lead to family breakup. </p>
<p>It is important, therefore, that people embrace family planning methods in order to cut down on the high rate of population growth.</p>
