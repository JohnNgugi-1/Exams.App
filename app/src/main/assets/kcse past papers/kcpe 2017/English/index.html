<p><b>Read the passage below and then answer questions 26 to 38.</b></p>
<p>How quickly things change! Only five years ago, Kazungu had no decent place to call home. His father was unhappy with him because he had become a habitual drunkard after doing badly in school.
The father feared that Kazungu would influence the rest of the family with his wayward behaviour. His room was so dirty that it stank to high heavens and even his friends, myself included, stopped visiting him.
All this time, his parents kept urging him to reform and they were very supportive. Their unconditional love seemed to make an impact.
Kazungu was changing, slowly but steadily. The improvement was obvious and I even started visiting him regularly. He still kept smelly socks and unwashed clothes in his tiny room. Besides, the bathroom was not one of the places he visited often.
He was struggling with the demons of dirt and disorderliness. I took it upon myself to keep nudging him to clean up and organise his life.
My efforts did not go to waste. Kazungu soon found something to do.
He started making kennels that were so attractive he could not satisfy the demand for them. He had begun to earn a decent living. Today, Kazungu lives in a magni?cent house and, believe me, that house is a house! It has all the modern gadgets and sofa set, the type you sit on and partly disappear.
The house is so comfortable that you feel uncomfortable if you are not used to such luxury. The funny thing is that Emma, Kazungu's childhood friend, greatly contributed to his success.
It began like a joke. Emma was selling clothes at her stall as usual while listening to die radio.
Then the caught her attention. He was inviting the public to nominate young entrepreneurs who were doing something innovative.
The nominees should also have overcome challenges to be where they Were. All that listeners were required to do was send a text message to a number that the announcer gave. 
They needed to give the name of the nominee, what he or she had done and what obstacles he or she had overcome. Out of goodness of heart, Emma decided to send Kazungu's name.
As she was to tell us later, she wanted to repay him for his generosity. He had once given her fifty shillings when she really needed it.
At the time, it was a real sacrifice on his part. She sent the name and soon forgot about it. A fortnight later, she received a call.
It was the radio presenter. He said that Emma's story about Kazungu was one of the most inspiring. He asked for KaZungu's contact.
Kazungu had been selected to undergo a six-month training on how to set up a business, market his products and make an impact in the community.
Kazungu embarked on the training with zeal. At the end of the course, he emerged the top student. That is how he ended up on television.
You should have heard the callers asking him questions that day. He spoke clearly, fluently and confidently. He became an instant hit.
The programme had transformed my friend. I was amazed. "Make one last comment," the presenter told Kazungu.
"I was a victim of a system which equates failing an exam to failing in life," he began calmly. "Education is important if individuals are to develop their full potential. However, young people also need to be encouraged to exploit their talents in sports, art, music or any other ?eld. 
Nobody had ever told me that l could succeed in life after failing my exams. I had felt frustrated and hopeless. In time, I had sought to drown my disappointments in alcohol. Thankfully, I'm now free."</p>

<p><b>Read the following passage and then answer questions 39 to 50.</b></p>
<p>Every one of us requires money from time to time. This is because we all have certain needs which can only be satis?ed by goods or services paid for using money. It is not surprising, therefore, that we spend a lot of time and energy in activities that can earn us money.
While there is nothing wrong in striving to make money, it is not right to let the desire for more and more of it be the only thing that controls our lives. Indeed, there is some truth in the old saying that the love of money is the root of all evil. Many wicked deeds have been done because of an uncontrolled desire for riches. Many are the people in jail for money-related crimes.
One of the main reasons why people easily become blinded by the love of money is that society thinks highly of people with deep pockets. Unfortunately, success is often measured by the amount of money one has. For this reason, some people would stop at nothing to acquire more and more.
A common joke is that for such money-hungry people, money is not everything; it is the only thing.
It is regrettable that such people spend most of their time thinking of how to make money without caring whether or not they use fair, legal or honest means.
It is important to realize that in life, there are other things more satisfying than money. One of these is good health. When we are free from any form of illness, we feel a sense of satisfaction. Stories are told of people with lots of money but who are miserable because of ill health. No wonder, someone said health is wealth.
Another source of satisfaction is sel?ess service to other people. When we try to make the lives of others better, we are doing a lot of good to ourselves. This is especially true when we do this regardless of whether or not we expect to bene?t. 
It is often said that the way to be happy is to make someone else happy. Happiness can also result from having good relationships with other people. Relating well with those who allow us to be ourselves who bring out the best in us can be truly rewarding. Freedom from guilt is yet another source of fulfillment.
Guilt is a negative feeling that can weigh us down by making us lack peace of mind and robbing us of happiness. One way to make ourselves free from guilt is to seek forgiveness from those we may have wronged.
It is therefore clear that money or wealth is not necessarily the key to happiness.
One can have these in plenty and yet be miserable. The story of King Midas best illustrates this. According to this Greek tale, the king prayed earnestly for lots of gold.
His prayers were answered and everything he touched turned into gold. Unfortunately, King Midas died of starvation for even when he tried to eat, his food turned into gold! For sure, money is one thing and happiness quite another.</p>
