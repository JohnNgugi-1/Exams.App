<b>Read the passage below and answer questions 26 to 38. </b>
<p>Our arrival at the Maasai Mara Game Reserve marked the beginning of what promised to be an 
exciting adventure. This was a superb way of starting my August holidays. My hard work at school had 
paid off. Previously mv marks were rather bad and neither my parents nor I liked them. Consequently, my parents were prompted to promise that if I did well in my end term exams, they would treat me to a first 
ever trip to the Maasai Mara. </p>
<p>As much as I wanted to fulfil my side of the bargain in order to visit the popular Maasai Mara, I felt it 
was my duty to improve on my performance and reclaim my position at the top. Need 1 tel! you that I was 
a fairly brilliant pupil and could not contend with average performance. The desire to satisfy my bruised 
ego propelled me to burn the midnight oil, revising like never before. Obviously, when the results of the 
end term examination were out, I was second to none. </p>
<p>Both my parents were ecstatic as we boarded the tour van. Not even the gloomy weather that had 
enveloped the park could dampen our spirits. My father being well aware of the terrain of the park had 
opted for a tour van since our sedan could easily have gotten stuck along the way and mined the 
sweetness of the adventure. </p>
<p>We need not have hired a tour guide since my father who was a frequent visitor to the park did most 
of the talking. He narrated excitedly how hundreds of thousands of wildebeests would cross over from the Serengeti National Park to the Maasai Mara every year. He further explained how the crocodiles that 
habitated the muddy River Mara took advantage of this migration and feasted on the unsuspecting 
wildebeests as they crossed the river. </p>
<p>Though disappointed that his opportunity to showcase his knowledge of the park was completely 
ruined, the enthusiastic tour guide marvelled at the exciting stories my father told about the park. Besides, 
the snacks I had pestered my mother to buy kept him busier than the herds of elephants that were doing a marvelous job at clearing every leafy plant in sight. </p>
<p>We had been riding in the van for close to three hours. So far we had managed to see countless 
animals including giraffes, zebras, buffaloes, gazelles, elephants among others. However, we had not been 
able to see any lions. Anyway, I was not looking forward to seeing any. I just didn’t like the damage they 
had been doing to people and domestic animals around the Nairobi National Park. </p>
<p>It was evident that everyone was tired of touring the park in a van. When I suggested that we explore the other parts on foot, no one objected. After all both our tour guide and the driver were armed. We felt immune to attack of any kind. </p>
<p>We saw different species of plants not to mention countless harmless herbivores that gave the park a glamorous look. The River Mara itself appeared quite calm and irresistibly alluring. Anyone new to it 
could easily rubbish the idea of it being infested with ferocious crocodiles. </p>
<p>When we were on our way back to the tour van, I made a mistake that nearly cost me my life. I had 
caught sight of a uniquely beautiful plant with very many glamorous' flowers. As curious as I was, I 
ventured into the bushes to get a few of the flowers. My parents and the two other men were so much engrossed in their chitchats to notice my small adventure. I must have collected the flowers for quite 
sometime because when I retraced my steps I could neither see nor hear my parents. Running as fast as I 
could in the direction of the van, 1 tripped on a protruding root and fell to the ground. Excruciating pain 
tore from my right ankle to the rest of the body; a clear indication that it was either twisted or fractured. </p>
<p>Fear clutched my heart as the truth dawned on me. I would not be able to stand, leave alone catching 
up with my parents. Feeling helpless, I let out a deafening scream hoping that a good Samaritan, if not my parents would come to my aid. A new bout of fear almost paralysed me when 1 heard my echo from a far. Nonetheless, I heard some movements that lifted my heart. At least someone had heard me. </p>
<p>My heart literally stopped beating when I saw ‘who’ my ‘helper’ was. A huge lion was crouching a 
couple of metres from me. I closed my eyes waiting for it to pounce on me and tear me apart. Then I 
heard a deafening sound. At first I thought 1 had already been torn apart by the lion. When I opened my 
eyes to confirm this, 1 could not believe what T saw. The lion was lying in a pool of blood: dead. 1 heaved 
a huge sigh of relief. A few metres away stood my parents and the two other men (now wielding rifles). 
Tears flooded my eyes as they all approached me.</p>

<b>Read the passage below and use it to answer questions 39 to 50. </b>
<p>Friendship is one of the most precious gifts of life. A person who has true friends in life is happier than he who has a lot of wealth. Friendship makes life thrilling. It makes life a pleasant and exciting experience. Friendship is indeed an asset in life. It can lead us to success or to doom. It all depends on how we choose our friends. </p>
<p>True friendship is a feeling of sharing and caring. It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are without any exaggeration, flattery and pretensions. It gives a feeling that you are ‘wanted* and that you are ‘someone’ and not a faceless being in the crowd. A true friend stands by you through thick and thin. True friendship knows no boundaries or demarcations of caste, creed, race and gender. </p>

They arc needed to turn to when one is in trouble and facing difficulties. Friends arc needed in every stage of life. Friendship has no age limit. Every group of people - children, youth and elders have their friends. However, it is better to have friends of the same age group. </p>
<p>However, the greatest challenge lies in choosing friends. One of the most important characteristics of a friend is their ability to be trusted. Finding those that you can rely on is essential in order to form a strong friendship, as you may share secrets and stories with them. You should also be able to count on them for their support and unconditional love. Be aware of the small acts of kindness that people do for you, and notice the overall dedication each person has made for you.</p>
<p>When choosing friends, ask yourself if they will always be there for you. You should find a friend who is willing to support you through difficult situations, whether they’re major or minor. Choosing a friend who gives you reliable advice is also recommended, as their words may have an impact on your choices. If you’re uncertain about how reliable a person is, ask them for help from time to time. Evaluate their reaction, and you’ll eventually start to see who your true friends are. </p>
<p>A healthy friendship allows both people to have a reasonable amount of control. If one person is bossing the other around, it becomes a dangerous relationship that may cause potential harm in the future. When you have made plans with a person or are expected to make an important decision together, be sure that you both have contributed ideas and are making the choice together. I ('you notice that the other person is dominating you and making all the decisions, you may want to re-evaluate your relationship with them. Realize that no person is better than the other. </p>
<p>Stay away from manipulative people. These people may trick you into making choices that are contrary to your wish. They may also manipulate you for their own gain. You should learn to recognize the signs of being controlled especially if they are harming you with their selfish actions. Understand that good friends are accepting and understanding. They will also recognize when you need your space. If you suspect that you are being manipulated in your friendship, you may want to talk to that person and possibly break it off </p>
<p>Good friends will keep your secrets and avoid telling lies about you. You can trust them with your innermost secrets. Anyone who goes round soiling your reputation is not worth keeping as a friend. Get rid of such characters. They will only make your life miserable.</p>
