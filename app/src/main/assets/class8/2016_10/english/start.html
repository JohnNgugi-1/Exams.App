<b>Read the following passage and then answer questions 26 to 38 </b>
<p>In the city of Nagara, there was a carpenter whose name was Ujjwalaka and who was extremely poor. One day he was pained to realize that every one else in his profession was rich and happy and that he alone was very poor. He thought Nagara was not the proper place for him to prosper and that he must go out and seek his fortune elsewhere. Then he left that city and began his journey to a new country. When the sun was fading, he reached a cave in a forest. </p>
<p>There he saw a female camel that separated from her caravan and just then delivered a child. The carpenter gave up his plans to go to another country and went home taking the camel and her calf with him. Every day he would go into the forest and bring back with him bundles of tender leaves for the camel and her child to eat. The camel regained her strength and the calf now' became an adult. The carpenter began selling camel milk and making good money. </p>
<p>Ujjwalaka loved the camel so much.that he bought a bell and hung it to her neck. One day he thought to himself, ?If one camel can bring so much money for me, how much more would I earn if 1 buy more camels and sell their milk?” He told his wife that he would borrow some money to go to Gujarat and buy a female camel and that she should take care of the one they had together with her calf till he returned from Gujarat. </p>
<p>He went to Gujarat and returned home with a female camel. Slowly, the number of camels he had increased several times. He appointed a keeper to take care of the camel herd he had on the condition that he would give one camel to the keeper every year as remuneration. The keeper was also free to drink camel milk twice a day. Now, everything was fine for the carpenter and he and his wife thus lived happily ever after. </p>
<p>The camels used to go every day to a nearby forest to feed on the fresh green leaves available in plenty in the forest. After spending a lot of time in the forest, eating and playing, the camels trekked back home. But the senior female camel stayed on in the forest and joined the herd later. The other camels thought that she was a fool to go her separate ways. What would she do if a wild animal attacked her? </p>
<p>One day a lion saw all the camels leaving the forest in a herd and one camel staying back and loafing about. By the time she finished her leisurely grazing, the others left and reached home. The she camel lost her way and was in panic when the lion, which was following her, pounced on her and soon tore her to pieces. </p>
<p>“That's why I tell you that he who does not follow the advice of wise men perishes like the camel,” said the monkey. </p>
<p>The croc replied, ‘‘You are right, if you follow advice given for your good you will face no danger either 
here or in the heaven above. Yet, what is great about doing good to a person who is good? He who helps a 
person who has done him harm is considered great by learned people. That's why take pity on me and give me 
advice.” </p>
<p>The monkey said, “In that case, you go and fight that big croc who has occupied your home. If you die in that battle, you will go to heaven. If you win the battle, you will get back your house. Know this from me: </p>
<p>“Conquer a good man with humility,</p> 
<p>Vanquish a hero with strategy, </p>
<p>Overcome the poor through small gifts</p>
<p>And crush equals with power.”</p>

<b>Read the following passage and then answer questions 39 to 50. </b>
<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a double-edged sword. It has led to development and can be hailed as the most significant achievement of humankind. However, one should not be blind to the challenge, or even the hazards, that ICT poses to the human race. </p>
<p>ICT has certainly made the world smaller. The phrase ‘global village’, coined in the 1960s by the Canadian scholar Marshall McLuhan, sounds truer today than at any other time in human history. Thanks to the wonders of the combination of computers, satellite wireless message transmission, the world has become a small place, like a village. This is in the sense that, even from the remotest comer of our planet, you can receive and send instant message. It is just like calling out to someone at the end of a short street in a small village and getting an instant response. </p>
<p>This instant communication is obviously a positive and useful development. Communication is so fast that it is a wonder that we were ever able to manage with only letters and the post office. Reference to such communication as ‘snail mail’ aptly conveys the sluggish nature of pre-Intemet communication. The speed with which information can be sent and received today has led to our era being dubbed ‘the communication age'. Our society, too, is described as ‘information- based society.’ We dare not act in ignorance when knowledge is, literally, available at the tip of our fingers and the tap of a button. </p>
<p>The picture, however, is not all rosy. The ease and speed with message can be coded, ‘loaded’ on to various channels and sent to any comer of the world poses a number of immediate dangers. Negative messages can easily be facilitated by ICT as positive ones. The information superhighway is hailed as a wonderful vehicle for information, research, education and knowledge in general. Unfortunately, it is equally a channel for evils such as fraud, terrorism, racism, hate discourse and illicit trade. Even at the individual level, the dangers of ICT cannot be overstated. A clear source of worrying examples is the rapidly evolving social 
networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p>These websites, where millions of people post and exchange masses of information including personal 
details, have become favourite hunting grounds for people with evil intentions. These villains are out to 
‘meet’ innocent and unsuspecting users of these sites, especially those who are young and naive, and take advantage of them. Numerous, cases are reported of people, young and old alike, who have been conned or 
killed by friends they made on the internet. One of the worst known cases was of a modern day cannibal 
who, in 2003, recruited his victim on the Internet, and ended up killing him, cutting him up and eating him.</p>
<p>A subtler hut also more pervasive problem of the communication revolution is that the human mind is not quite adapted to the speed at which ICT feeds information into it. In other words, people are receiving so many messages so fast that they just cannot digest them. They do not know how to react to the information. </p>
<p>Whether it is numbers or gory images of mutilated bodies on our screens, our responses to what we see and hear through the media have become troublingly dull. We are, thus, developing into a rather shallow and insensitive society. In other words, we see, hear and read so many messages that we have not time to reflect on them. Information is rapidly becoming mere texts, sounds and images, with no meaning. </p>
<p>Thus, the biggest challenge that information communication technology poses for us is the re-education of society to rediscover the values of serious thought and reflection. This might reinstate true insight and empathy that make us truly human.</p>
