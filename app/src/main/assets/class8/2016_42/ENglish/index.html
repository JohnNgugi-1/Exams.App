<b>Read the passage below and use it to answer questions 26 to 38 </b>
<p>Ochanda led a busy life. He hardly got time for himself. With teaching and organizing the school he had pioneered, he seemed to be busy every minute. He also acted as the clerk of a local welfare group which was certainly his brainchild. He was now known and loved all over the region. Everyone heaped praises on him. Children knew him and hailed him us ‘Our Teacher’ Old men and women called him ‘the saviour.’ He was a man who had magically transformed the lives of the locals. He had taught their children English, the white man’s language. Through his efforts, people had started small business to earn income. He sensitized them to plant more trees and use their farms for crop production. Ochanda found pleasure in helping his people. </p>
<p>One day, he organized a meeting for all parents. He wanted to press for more schools although he had no. idea how he would get teachers. He thought he might be able to persuade some to come from the city. He felt that by meeting the adults in the region, he would also find a chance to reconcile the two villages: Kamenya and Kadero. This ancient rivalry would cripple his efforts in fostering education and civilization in the region. He hoped to preach peace during the meeting hence eliminate any feelings of hatred between the two villages. Despite his strong <b>conviction</b> that he could be the instrument of peace, he knew it would not the so easy a mission. </p>
<p>On the day of the meeting, the whole grass compound was full of women and men from every corner of the region. Some came to hear the report on the progress of their children. Others came to see the well - known Got - Nyabondo school. But most came to see ‘the Teacher’ They had heard of this young man, but had never seen him. This was a chance not to be missed. Ochanda’s fame had grown from ridge to ridge and spread like fire in dry bush. Everyone saw him as the redeemer of their land. </p>
<p>The school was neat. Everyone went round the school admiring the well - mudded building. Here and there on the compound were little gardens whose general look was the talk of all. Ochanda, along with his colleagues, mixed with the people freely. He personally took them round the school. In their chit - chats, he light - heartedly campaigned for his scheme before the real test came. He was digging out the seeds of discord and replacing them with the seeds of reconciliation. People admired his wisdom. They liked the way he freely mingled and the way he talked. He pleased many though not all. At such moments jealousy and ill - will are bound to work. A few of Ochanda’s colleagues did not fancy the attention he was getting. They were beginning to develop hatred for him.</p>
<p>The meeting was scheduled to begin early. However, with the glamorous looks of the school, people spent a couple of hours feasting their eyes on such rare beauty. It was no wonder that the meeting began in the afternoon. Ochanda opened the proceedings amid great silence. Though his voice was calm, his heart beat inside him. He feared the number of eyes infront of him. He narrated 
a short story about the need of unity for the region to prosper. He told them the many demerits of hatred and selfishness. His words pierced through the hearts of many. Guilt was visible on their countenances. He had awakened them from their shortcomings. Their was a new being created in them. They inwardly vowed to embrace unity.</p>

<p>Hellena has had to overcome countless challenges and difficulties as she strives to remain alive. Although she holds a respectable job, things have not been easy for him. Succees has not come easily to her due to her limited mobility. Hellena works for a well - known organization in the country inspite of her limitation. Her success in life can be attributed to her great determination, positive outlook and remarkable friends. </p>
<p>During her days in the university, she faced unbearable difficulties in accessing places, such as the library, computer labs, lecture halls and canteens. The lack of an elevator prevented her from 
going to the library and computer labs which were on the first floor. Furthermore, unlike the able- bodied students who used a short path to get to the lecture halls, Hellena had to cross a big field in her wheelchair. Sometimes, the field got muddy during the rainy season and the mud would stick to the wheels making it difficult for the wheelchair to move. </p>
<p>Eventually Hellena would reach the lecture hall with a smile on her face and without any complains. The lack of facilities for disabled students on campus did not discourage her from obtaining her certificates from the university. It would be a lie to say that Hellena did not even shed 
tear while handling the unfriendly campus environment. Each time she had to get through, she felt
sad. But this made her more determined than ever to get what she wanted. </p>
<p>Hellena also has remarkable friends who have helped her be where she is today. She considers her friends as treasures who must be cherished. She doesn’t have many friends, but the few friends she has are sincere, helpful and <b>trustworthy</b>. At university, her friends were there to support and help her since she was staying away from home.

Hellena was grateful since the help she got from her friends was extended over a long period of time. </p>
<p>Hellena’s perseverance, positive outlook and wonderful friends have paved the way for success. Hellena has managed to achieve what she wants in life: having a good and stable job and also a circle of friends who bring much cheer to her.</p>
