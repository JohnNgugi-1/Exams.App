<p>Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of fear.  <br/><i> Mark Twain   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.  <br/><i> Les Brown   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> Do one thing every day that scares you. <br/><i>  Eleanor Roosevelt  </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. <br/><i>Marianne Williamson    </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure. <br/><i>Paulo Coelho    </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.  <br/><i>  Frank Herbert  </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life. <br/><i>  John Lennon  </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Fear cuts deeper than swords.  <br/><i> George R.R. Martin   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Don't be afraid of your fears. They're not there to scare you. They're there to let you know that something is worth it.  <br/><i>  C. JoyBell C  </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity. <br/><i>  Paulo Coelho  </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it.  <br/><i> Salvador Dali   </i></p>

</div>
<div>
<p> Do not be afraid; our fate Cannot be taken from us; it is a gift.<br/><i> Dante Alighieri   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.  <br/><i> Nelson Mandela   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire. <br/><i>Dan Brown    </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have accepted fear as part of life – specifically the fear of change... I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back..  <br/><i> Erica Jong   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ... so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.  <br/><i>Yann Martel    </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> Find out what you're afraid of and go live there.  <br/><i>Chuck Palahniuk     </i></p>
