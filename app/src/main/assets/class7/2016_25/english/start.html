<p><b>READ THE FOLLOWING'PASSAGE AND ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT FOLLOW </b></p>
<p>Long ago the hare, the hyena and the dog used to live as  great friends. Even other animals 
would always  shudder with amazement how these three animals  could be so friendly 
and yet very different from each other! </p>
<p>Then, one day the hyena was invited for a party by his in-laws. And like a good friend, he 
decided to ask his friends to accompany him to his in-laws for the feast. The friends on their 
part did not disappoint him and they agreed to offer company. </p>
<p>The hyena and his friends were given a reception of the highest degree one could expect from 
in-laws. They were treated to a great feast. They ate and drank to their fill. They danced and 
got the best possible entertainment. It was really an entertaining visit; a very colourful 
entertainment! </p>
<p>When darkness came and it was already night time, the hyena and his friends were shown 
where to sleep. This was in the same room where sheep and goats were kept. But the greedy 
hyena could not be trusted! In the thick of the*night, all the animals were deeply asleep except 
the hyena-. The. greedy hyena could not control his hunger. He kept yawning and swallowing the 
saliva of glutton and glancing at the sheep near him. He stealthily walked to one ram and held 
it by the throat so as to not make noise and awaken the friends. Very quickly the hyena 
strangled and ate the ram. Then he smeared blood on the lips of his friends carefully and then 
went to sleep as if nothing had happened. But the hyena's tricks did not work quite well. His 
friends licked their lips while still in sleep and they became as clean as they had been before. </p>
<p>When the hyena's father-in-law went to check his flock, he discovered that one ram was 
missing' He at once asked his guest to explain who was responsible for the ungrateful act. 
Nobody answered. Perhaps the matter would have ended unresolved. But the hare thought it 
was a good chance for him to trick down the thief. So he called the hyena's father-in -law and 
whispered for a little while. Then the hyena's in-law rushed out. No sooner had he left than he
reappeared. He returned, brandishing a panga in hand and shouting viciously. "I have discovered
the thief who killed my ram and I am going to teach him a lesson. I will slash and crush him like flour"</p>
<p>The hyena was already trembling with fear and trying hard not to show it. He was panic- stricken. 
Then, suddenly, the dog dashed out and ran as fast as his legs could carry him with thin sweat 
dripping out of his body. The hyena burst out into a loud laughter which reached the dog's ears. 
This laughter made the dog confirm his fears that the hare had actually blamed him for the offence. 
That is why to this day the dog and the hare do not see eye to eye.</p>

<p>Many people treat their bodies in the same way. It is easy to remember to eat enough to
satisfy hunger. just as it is easy to remember to put petrol in a car. But it is often forgotten that
body building foods (proteins) and foods to keep the body healthy (vitamins and mineral salts) 
are  also  needed to keep the vital parts in good working order. Such foods are important 
for children especially when they are growing fast.</p>
<p>A new born baby should have the,mother's milk. This means that the mother must 
eat plenty of good food to have sufficient milk. She should also drink a lot of milk, water 
and fruit juices, but not too much tea or coffee. If she does  not have enough milk, she should go to the 
hospital or a health centre to learn the proper way of mixing milk with sugar and water for the baby to take. </p>
<p>The feeding of a baby requires special care. For example one should never feed a baby 
with the bottle without proper advice from qualified people. In addition, we should ensure that 
babies get proper food. Drinks like tea and squash are not good for babies. </p>
<p>Even when a baby is breast - feeding, he must learn to feed at regular times. 
Some people mistakenly think that a baby cries just because he is hungry. 
There are many things which make a baby cry; his clothes may be wet or he may be 
<b>uncomfortable</b> and want to be turned over. Most common of all, he may have wind in his stomach. 
When a baby sucks, he sucks milk and wind, so that his stomach is full of 
milk as well as wind. If you do not get the wind out after a feed, he will 
become uncomfortable and soon begin to cry. When you have finished feeding him, pat him gently 
on the back to make him release some of the wind through the mouth. Then he will sleep peacefully.
