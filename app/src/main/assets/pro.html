</div>

<p>You may not be punished for your procrastination, but for sure you will be punished by your procrastination.  <br/><i>Debasish Mridha    </i></p>

<p>Time is an equal opportunity employer. Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day. Rich people can't buy more hours. Scientists can't invent new minutes. And you can't save time to spend it on another day. Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving. No matter how much time you've wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow.  <br/><i> Denis Waitley   </i></p>
</div>

<p>Following-through is the only thing that separates dreamers from people that accomplish great things.  <br/><i> Gene Hayden   </i></p>

<p> Stop talking. Start walking. <br/><i> L.M. Heroux   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.  <br/><i>Lucius Annaeus Seneca    </i></p>

</div>
<div>
<p>This one makes a net, this one stands and wishes. Would you like to make a bet which one gets the fishes.  <br/><i> Chinese Rhyme   </i></p>
</div>

<p>A primary reason people don't do new things is because they want to do them perfectly the first time. It's completely irrational, impractical, not workable and yet, it's how most people run their lives. It's called The Perfection Syndrome.  <br/><i> John-Roger and Peter McWlliams   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If and When were planted, and Nothing grew.  <br/><i> Proverb   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We shall never have more time. We have, and have always had, all the time there is. No object is served in waiting until next week or even until tomorrow. Keep going day in and day out. Concentrate on something useful. Having decided to achieve a task, achieve it at all costs.  <br/><i> Arnold Bennett   </i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step. <br/><i> Martin Luther King, Jr.   </i></p>
