<p>At school, pupils are always advised to wash their hands before handling food and after a visit to the toilet. Most pupils ignore this advice, and expose themselves to the risk of contracting diseases which make them ill. </p>
<p>When we eat food with dirty hands, we risk ourselves in getting food poisoning. This is caused by a bacteria called salmonella which lives in the intestines of people and animals. It can also be found in soil, water, raw food and faeces of some animals. Most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhoea, fever and abdominal pains 12-72 hours after infection. Although most patients recover without treatment, in some cases, the diarrhoea may be so severe that it leads to hospitalisation and treatment with antibiotics. </p>
<p>A few varieties of salmonella bacteria can also result to typhoid, a sometimes deadly disease. Young children, elderly people and those with weak immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.</p>
