He spoke angrily, demanding an immediate solution to his problems. For a long time, the wise man remained calm. Then he looked up at the angry man and said, “Before we solve your problem, go down this road and you will find five pots by the wayside. Ask each pot if you can drink water from it and come and then we will discuss your problem.” </p>
<p>As he said so, the wise man gave him a small cup and pointed him down a road that seemed endless. The angry man traveled a long way before he came upon the first pot. He said to the pot, “Pot, can I drink from you?” “Yes, you can,” replied the pot. “But I contain the water of laughter. He dipped his cup and before he could take a sip, his mind opened.

<b>Read the passage below and use it to answer questions 41 - 50 </b>
<p>At school, pupils are always advised to wash their hands before handling food and after a visit to the toilet. Most pupils ignore this advice, and expose themselves to the risk of contracting diseases which make them ill. </p>
<p>When we eat food with dirty hands, we risk ourselves in getting food poisoning. This is caused by a bacteria called salmonella which lives in the intestines of people and animals. It can also be found in soil, water, raw food and faeces of some animals. Most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhoea, fever and abdominal pains 12-72 hours after infection. Although most patients recover without treatment, in some cases, the diarrhoea may be so severe that it leads to hospitalisation and treatment with antibiotics. </p>
<p>A few varieties of salmonella bacteria can also result to typhoid, a sometimes deadly disease. Young children, elderly people and those with weak immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.</p>
