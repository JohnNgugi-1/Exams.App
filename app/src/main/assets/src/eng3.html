<h2>Verbs</h2>

A verb is a "doing" word. A verb can express:

<ul>
<li> A physical action (e.g., <i>to swim</i>, <i>to write</i>, <i>to climb</i>).</li>
<li> A mental action (e.g., <i>to think</i>, <i>to guess</i>, <i>to consider</i>).</li>
<li> A state of being (e.g., <i>to be</i>, <i>to exist</i>, <i>to appear</i>).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Verbs Can Express Physical Actions</h2>
Here are some sentences with verbs that express physical actions. (In each example, the verb is highlighted.)

<ul>
<li> She <b>sells</b> pegs and lucky heather.</li>
(In this example, the word <i>sells</i> is a verb. It expresses the physical activity <i>to sell</i>.)
<li> The doctor <b>wrote</b> the prescription.</li>
(In this example, the word <i>wrote</i> is a verb. It expresses the physical activity <i>to write</i>.)
<li> Alison <b>bought</b> a ticket.</li>
(The word <i>bought</i> is a verb. It expresses the physical activity <i>to buy</i>.)
</ul>

<h2>Verbs Can Express Mental Actions</h2>
While many verbs express physical actions (e.g., <i>to jump</i>, <i>to dance</i>, <i>to sing</i>), verbs can also express mental actions. For example:

<ul>

<li> She <b>considers</b> the job done.</li>
(The word <i>considers</i> is a verb. It expresses the mental activity <i>to consider</i>.)

<li> Peter <b>guessed</b> the right number.</li>
(The word <i>guessed</i> is a verb. It expresses the mental activity <i>to guess</i>.)

<li> I <b>thought</b> the same thing.</li>
(The word <i>thought</i> is a verb. It expresses the mental activity <i>to think</i>.)
</ul>

<h2>Verbs Can Express a State of Being</h2>
A small but extremely important group of verbs do not express any activity at all. The most important verb in this group (arguably of all) is the verb <i>to be</i>.<br><br> 

Here is the verb <i>to be</i> in the different <a /tense.htm">tenses</a>:<br><br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tbody><tr><th rowspan="2">Subject</th><th colspan="3">Verb <i>to be</i></th></tr>

<tr><th>past tense</th>
<th>present tense</th>
<th>future tense</th>  
</tr>
<tr><td>I</td>
<td>was</td>
<td>am</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr>
<tr><td>You</td>
<td>were</td>

<tr><td>They</td>

<td>will be</td>  
</tr></tbody></table>
<br>

Here are some real examples with the verb <i>to be</i>:

<ul>
<li> Edwina <b>is</b> the largest elephant in this area.</li>
(The word <i>is</i> is a verb from the verb <i>to be</i>.)
<li> It <b>was</b> a joke.</li>
(The word <i>was</i> is a verb from the verb <i>to be</i>.)
<li> I <b>am</b>.</li>
(The word <i>am</i> is a verb from the verb <i>to be</i>.)<br>(Point of interest: <i>I am</i> is the shortest sentence in English.)
</ul>


<h2>The Types of Verbs</h2>
As we've covered, a verb can be categorized as a physical verb (e.g., to run), a mental verb (e.g., to think), or a state-of-being verb (e.g., to be). However, a verb will often be further categorized as one of the following:

<h2>Action Verb</h2>
An action verb expresses an activity that a person or thing can do. For example: 

<ul>
<li> Lee <b>eats</b> cake. </li>
(<i>Eating</i> is something Lee can do.) 
<li> The bear <b>chased</b> the salmon in the shallow rapids. </li>
(<i>Chasing</i> is something the bear can do.)
</ul>

Compare those verbs with these:

<ul>
<li> Lee <b>likes</b> cake. </li>
(<i>To like</i> is not an activity. It's a state.) 
<li> The bear <b>is</b> hungry. </li>
(<i>To be</i> is not an activity. It's a state.)
</ul>

<h2>Stative Verb</h2>
A stative verb expresses a state rather than an action. A stative verb typically relates to a state of being, a thought, or an emotion. For example: 

<ul>
<li> I <b>am</b> at home. </li>
<li> She <b>believes</b> in fairies. </li>
<li> He <b>feels</b> elated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transitive Verb</h2>
A transitive verb is one that acts on something (i.e., it has a <a /direct_object.htm">direct object</a>). For example: 

<ul>
<li> I <b>saw</b> the dog. </li>
(Here, the direct object is <i>the dog</i>.)
<li> Lee <b>ate</b> the pie. </li>
(Here, the direct object is <i>the pie</i>.)
<li> The postman <b>will give</b> Sarah the letter.</li>
(Here, the direct object is <i>the letter</i>.)
</ul>

Note: The direct object of a transitive verb can be found by finding the verb and asking "what?" For example, "saw what?" (answer: the dog); "ate what?" (answer: the pie); "will give what?" (answer: the letter).<br><br>



<h2>Intransitive Verb</h2>
An intransitive verb is one that does not act on something (i.e., there is no direct object). For example: 

<ul>
<li> The rain <b>fell</b>.</li>
<li> My throat <b>hurts</b>.</li>
<li> The cat <b>sneezed</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Auxiliary Verb</h2>
An auxiliary verb (or <a /helping_verb.htm">helping verb</a>) accompanies a main verb to help express <a /tense.htm">tense</a>, <a /voice.htm">voice</a> or <a /mood.htm">mood</a>. The most common auxiliary verbs are <i>be</i>, <i>do</i>, and <i>have</i> (in their various forms). Here are some examples of auxiliary verbs:
 
<ul>
<li> Lee <b>has</b> eaten all the pies. </li>
(Here, the auxiliary verb <i>has</i> helps to express <a /tense.htm">tense</a>.) 

<li> The table <b>has been</b> prepared. </li>
(Here, the auxiliary verbs <i>has been</i> help to express <a /voice.htm">voice</a> (in this case, the <a /passive_voice.htm">passive voice</a>).)

<li>If he <b>were</b> to arrive in the next 10 minutes, we <b>would</b> be on schedule.</li> 
(Here, the auxiliary verbs <i>were</i> and <i>would</i> help to express <a /voice.htm">mood</a> (in this case, the <a /subjunctive_mood.htm">subjunctive mood</a>).)

</ul>



<h2>Modal Verb</h2>
A modal verb is a type of auxiliary verb used to express ideas such as ability, possibility, permission, and obligation. The modal auxiliary verbs are <i>can</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>ought to</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>will</i>, and <i>would</i>. For example:

<ul>
<li> Lee <b>can</b> eat a lot of pies.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb <i>can</i> helps to express the idea of ability.) 
<li> Lee <b>might</b> eat that pie before he gets home.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb <i>might</i> helps to express the idea of possibility.) 
<li> Lee <b>may</b> eat as many pies as he likes.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb <i>may</i> helps to express the idea of permission.) 
<li> Lee <b>should</b> give you some of that pie given you bought it.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb <i>should</i> helps to express the idea of obligation.) 
</ul>



<h2>Phrasal Verb</h2>
A phrasal verb is a verb made up of more than one word (usually two words). A phrasal verb has a main verb and another word (either a <a >preposition</a> or a particle). The phrasal verb usually has a meaning different to the main verb. For example:

<ul>
<li> A burglar will often break a window to <b>break in</b>.</li> 
(Here, the phrasal verb <i>break in</i> means <i>to enter illegally</i>, which is different to <i>break</i>.) 
<li> If you drop the baton the team will <b>drop back</b> to last place.</li> 
(Here, the phrasal verb <i>drop back</i> means <i>to fall behind</i>, which is different to <i>drop</i>.) 
</ul>



<h2>Regular and Irregular Verbs</h2>
A <a /regular_verbs.htm">regular verb</a> is one that forms its <a /simple_past_tense.htm">simple past tense</a> and its <a /past_participles.htm">past participle</a> by adding <b>-ed</b> or <b>-d</b> to the <a /base_form.htm">base form</a> of the verb. (Note: There are spelling rules to consider too.) For example:<br><br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Regular Verb</th><th>Simple Past Tense</th><th>Past Participle</th></tr>

<tr><td>love</td><td>loved</td><td>has loved</td></tr>
<tr><td>hate</td><td>hated</td><td>has hated</td></tr>
<tr><td>move</td><td>moved</td><td>has moved</td></tr>
</tbody></table><br>

An irregular verb is one that does not conform to this ruling. For example: <br><br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tbody><tr><th>Irregular Verb</th><th>Simple Past Tense</th><th>Past Participle</th></tr>
<tr><td>tell</td><td>told</td><td>has told</td></tr>
<tr><td>bleed</td><td>bled</td><td>has bled</td></tr>
</tbody></table><br>

<h2>Verb Terminology</h2>

There is a lot of grammatical terminology associated with verbs. Below are explanations of the most common terms. <p>

<h2>The Infinitive Form</h2>

When a verb is preceded by the word <i>to</i>, it is said to be in its <a /infinitive_form.htm">infinitive form</a> (i.e., its most basic form).

<ul>
<li> I have to smoke that!</li>
(<i>To smoke</i> is the infinitive form of the verb.)
</ul>




<h2>Past Tense</h2>

Verbs that express actions in the past are said to be in the <a /past_tense.htm">past tense</a>.

<ul>
<li> He <b>talked</b> with more claret than clarity. (Susan Ertz)</li>
(<i>Talked</i> is the past tense of the verb <i>to talk</i>.)<br><br>
<li> I <b>ran</b> to the lake.</li>
(<i>Ran</i> is the past tense of the verb <i>to run</i>.)<br><br>
<li> They <b>were</b> all there.</li>
(<i>Were</i> is the past tense of the verb <i>to be</i>.)
</ul>

<h2>Present Tense</h2>

Verbs that express actions occurring now are said to be in the <a /present_tense.htm">present tense</a>.

<ul>
<li> John <b>jumps</b> out the window.</li>
(<i>Jumps</i> is the present tense of the verb <i>to jump</i>.)<br><br>
<li> Who <b>is</b> ill?</li>
(<i>Is</i> is the present tense of the verb <i>to be</i>.)<br><br>

<li> He <b>is</b> the kind of a guy who <b>lights up</b> a room just by flicking a switch.</li>
(<i>Is</i> is the present tense of the verb <i>to be</i>, and 
<i>lights up</i> is the present tense of the verb <i>to light up</i>.)
</ul>

<h2>Future Tense</h2>

Verbs that express actions in the future are said to be in the <a /future_tense.htm">future tense</a>. These are usually formed by preceding the verb with the word <i>will</i>.

<ul>
<li> I <b>will take</b> the blame.</li>
(<i>Will take</i> is the future tense of the verb <i>to take</i>.)<br><br>
<li> They <b>will surrender</b>. </li>
(<i>Will surrender</i> is the future tense of the verb <i>to surrender</i>.)<br><br>
<li> Give me where to stand, and I <b>will move</b> the earth. (Archimedes, 287-212 BC)</li>
(<i>Will move</i> is the future tense of the verb <i>to move</i>.)
</ul>


<h2>Subject of a Verb</h2>

The person or thing performing the action of the verb is said to be the <a /subject.htm">subject of the
verb</a> or the <i>subject of the sentence</i>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Tony</b> stole the boat.</li>
(<i>Tony</i> is the subject of the verb <i>to steal</i>.)<br><br>
<li> <b>The dog</b> is guilty.</li>
(<i>The dog</i> is the subject of the verb <i>to be</i>.)<br><br>
<li> <b>Who</b> was that?</li>
(<i>Who</i> is the subject of the verb <i>to be</i>.)
</ul>




<h2>Direct Object of a Verb</h2>

Many verbs perform an action on something. This is called the <a /direct_object.htm">direct object</a> of the verb.

<ul>
<li> Terry kissed <b>her hand</b>.</li>
(<i>Her hand</i> is the direct object of the verb <i>to kiss</i>.)<br><br>
<li> Beverly can eat <b>a whole chicken</b>.</li>
(<i>A whole chicken</i> is the direct object of the verb <i>to eat</i>.)
</ul>

Some verbs cannot have a direct object. These verbs are called <a /intransitive_verbs.htm">intransitive verbs</a>.

<ul>
<li> The rain <b>fell</b> heavily.</li>
(The rain fell, but it did not perform an action on anything.&nbsp;In this example, the verb <i>to fall</i> is an intransitive verb.)<br><br>
<li> Jack <b>protested</b> in the street.</li>
(Jack protested, but he did not perform an action on anything. In this example, the verb <i>to protest</i> is an intransitive verb.)
</ul>

Verbs that can have a direct object (most of them) are called <a /transitive_verbs.htm">transitive verbs</a>.

<ul>
<li> Barney <b>copied</b> the answer.</li>
(The verb <i>copied</i> is a transitive verb. The direct object of the verb is <i>the answer</i>.)<br><br>
<li> Terry <b>saw</b> a black fin cutting through the water.</li>
(The verb <i>saw</i> is a transitive verb. The direct object of the verb is <i>a black fin</i>.)
</ul>



<h2>Indirect Object of a Verb</h2>

Some verbs have two objects, a direct object and an <a /indirect_object.htm">indirect
object</a>. The indirect object is the person or thing for whom the action was performed.


<ul>
<li> Jamie read <b>the children</b> a story.</li>
(Here, <i>a story</i> is the direct object, and <i>the children</i> is the indirect object.)<br><br>
<li> I will bake <b>him</b> a cake.</li>
(Here, <i>a cake</i> is the direct object, and <i>him</i> is the indirect object.)<br><br>
<li> The postman gives <b>Anne</b> a letter every day.</li>
(Here, <i>a letter</i> is the direct object, and <i>Anne</i> is the indirect object.)
</ul>




<h2>Passive Sentence</h2>

The subject of a sentence does not always do the action of the verb. Sometimes, the action is done to the subject. Such sentences are called <a /passive_sentences.htm">passive sentences</a> because the subjects are being passive, i.e., not doing anything.&nbsp;

<ul>
<li> Carl was arrested.</li>
(<i>Carl</i> is not doing anything, but he is the subject of the sentence.)<br>
(Note: <i>Carl</i> is the subject of the verb <i>to be</i>.)
</ul>

Passive verbs always comprise two parts (<i>was arrested</i> in this example). The person doing the action of the verb in a passive sentence is usually shown with the word <i>by</i>.

<ul>
<li> Carl was arrested by PC Adams.</li>
</ul>

Passive verbs are said to be in the <a /passive_voice.htm">passive voice</a>. Passive sentences can be quite useful:

<ul>
<li> The carpet was damaged.</li>
(This is a passive sentence. No one is blamed for damaging the carpet.)
<li> Mark damaged the carpet.</li>
(A passive sentence contrasts with an active sentence (where the subject performs the verb). This is an example of an active sentence. It tells us that Mark damaged the carpet.)
</ul>



<h2>Active Sentence</h2>

<a >Active sentences</a> contrast with passive sentences. In an active sentence, the subject of the verb performs the action.

<ul>
<li> We damaged the carpet.</li>
(This is an active sentence. <i>We</i> is the subject. <i>We damaged</i> the carpet.)<br><br>
<li> Jamie read a story.</li>
(This is an active sentence. <i>Jamie</i> is the subject. <i>Jamie read</i> a story.)
</ul>



<h2>Conjugation of Verbs</h2>

A verb will change its form a little depending on the subject. For example:

<ul>
<li> I write.</li>
<li> He writes.</li><br>

<li> The jackal laughs.</li>
<li> The jackals laugh.</li>
</ul>

When verbs change in this way, it is known as <i>conjugation</i>. A verb conjugates according to the subject. The subject of a verb can be in one of six forms:

<ul>
<li>I</li>
<li>You</li>
<li>He / She / It</li>
<li>We</li>
<li>You</li>
<li>They</li>
</ul>

The first three are the singular forms (known as <a /first_person.htm">first person</a> singular, <a /second_person.htm">second person</a> singular, and <a /third_person.htm">third person</a> singular). The second three are the plural forms (known as first person plural, second person plural and third person plural).<br><br>

All subjects fit into one of these categories. For example, <i>jackal</i> is like <i>he</i> (i.e., third person singular) and <i>jackals</i> is like <i>they</i> (i.e., third person plural). (This subject rarely causes problems for native English speakers, who conjugate verbs correctly without much thought.)<br><br>

Interestingly, this is the origin of the insurance term <i>third party</i> (i.e., it's insurance covering actions by "them").<br><br>



<h2>Participles</h2>

Participles are formed from verbs. There are two types: <a /present_participle.htm">present participles</a> and <a /past_participles.htm">past participles</a>. Present participles end <b>-ing</b>. Past participles have various endings (e.g., <b>-ed</b>, <b>-en</b>). Below is a table showing some participles:<br><br>

<table class="gridtable"><tbody><tr>
<th>Verb</th>
<th>Present Participle</th>
<th>Past Participle</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to sing</td>
<td>singing</td>
<td>sung</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to drive</td>
<td>driving</td>
<td>driven</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to go</td>
<td>going</td>
<td>gone</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to rise</td>
<td>rising</td>
<td>risen</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to watch</td>
<td>watching</td>
<td>watched</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to be</td>
<td>being</td>
<td>been</td>
</tr>

</tbody></table><br>

Participles are classified as adjectives. (Note: When a verb form (like a participle) functions as an adjective or a noun, it is known as a <a /verbals.htm">verbal</a>.) Below are some examples of participles being used as adjectives:

<ul>
<li> Our business is badly affected by the <b>soaring</b> price of wool.</li>
(The word <i>soaring</i> is a present participle. Here, it is being used as an adjective to describe <i>price</i>.)<br><br>

<li> He is a <b>forgotten</b> hero.</li>
(The word <i>forgotten</i> is a past participle. Here, it is being used as an adjective to describe <i>hero</i>.)
</ul>
