<h2>Adjectives</h2>

Adjectives describe nouns and pronouns. (<i>Old</i>, <i>green</i>, and <i>cheerful</i> are examples of adjectives.)
 
<h2>Easy Examples of Adjectives</h2>

In each example, the adjective is highlighted.<br><br>

An adjective usually comes directly before the noun or pronoun it describes (or modifies, as they say).

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">old</span> man</li>
<li><span class="highlight">green</span> coat</li>
<li><span class="highlight">cheerful</span> one</li>
</ul>

(When adjectives are used like this, they're called <i>attributive adjectives</i>.)<br><br>

An adjective can come after the noun.

<ul>
<li>Jack was <span class="highlight">old</span>.</li>
<li>It looks <span class="highlight">green</span>.</li>
(Adjectives can describe - or modify - pronouns too.)
<li>He seems <span class="highlight">cheerful</span>.</li>
</ul>

In the three examples above, the adjectives have followed linking verbs (<i>was</i>, <i>looks</i>, and <i>seems</i>) to describe the noun or pronoun. (When adjectives are used like this, they're called <a ../glossary/predicate_adjectives.htm">predicative adjectives</a>.)<br><br>

Sometimes, an adjective comes immediately after a noun.

<ul>
<li>the Princess <span class="highlight">Royal</span></li>
<li>time <span class="highlight">immemorial</span></li>
<li>body <span class="highlight">beautiful</span></li>
<li>the best seats <span class="highlight">available</span></li>
<li>the worst manners <span class="highlight">imaginable</span></li>
</ul>   

When adjectives are used like this, they're called <i>postpositive adjectives</i>. Postpositive adjectives are most common with pronouns.
 
<ul>
<li>someone <span class="highlight">interesting</span></li>
<li>those <span class="highlight">present</span></li>
<li>something <span class="highlight">evil</span></li>
</ul>


A descriptive adjective will usual fit into one of the following categories:<br>


<table class="gridtable">
<tbody><tr><th>Category</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>Appearance</td><td>attractive, burly, clean, dusty</td></tr>
<tr><td>Colour</td><td>azure, blue, cyan, dark</td></tr>
<tr><td>Condition</td><td>absent, broken, careful, dead</td></tr>
<tr><td>Personality</td><td>annoying, brave, complex, dizzy</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quantity</td><td>ample, bountiful, countless, deficient</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sense</td><td>aromatic, bitter, cold, deafening</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nostretch">Size and Shape</td><td>angular, broad, circular, deep</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time</td><td>ancient, brief, concurrent, daily</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>The Transition from Adjectives to "Determiners"</h2>

For centuries, the term "adjective" has been used for a word type now called determiners. Determiners are still classified as adjectives by most people but not everyone . Determiners indicate qualities such as the following:

<ul>
<li> Possession (e.g., <i><span class="highlight">my</span> dog</i>)</li>
<li>Specificity (e.g., <i><span class="highlight">that</span> dog</i>)</li>
<li>Quantity (e.g., <i><span class="highlight">one</span> dog</i>)</li>
<li>Definiteness (e.g., <i><span class="highlight">a</span> dog</i>)</li>
</ul>

Regardless of whether you classify determiners as adjectives, this much is true: determiners are not like descriptive adjectives. Here are the four main differences between determiners and normal adjectives:<br><br>

<b>(Difference 1) A determiner cannot have a comparative form.</b>

<ul>
<li>Normal adjective: pretty &gt; prettier</li>
(<i>Prettier</i> is the comparative form of <i>pretty</i>.)
<li>Determiner: that &gt; [nothing fits here]</li>
(There is no comparative form.)
</ul>

<b>(Difference 2) A determiner often cannot be removed from the sentence.</b>

<ul>
<li>Normal adjectives removed: The <strike>young</strike> boy stole a <strike>silver</strike> watch. </li>
(This is grammatically sound with the normal adjectives removed.)
<li>Determiner: <strike>The</strike> Young boy stole <strike>a</strike> silver watch. </li>
(The sentence is flawed with the determiners removed.)
</ul>

<b>(Difference 3) A determiner often refers back to something (i.e., it's like a <a pronouns.htm">pronoun</a>).</b>

<ul>
<li>Determiner: Release <b>those</b> prisoners immediately.</li>
(The determiner <i>those</i> refers back to something previously mentioned. In other words, it has an antecedent (the thing it refers to).)
</ul>

<b>(Difference 4) A determiner cannot be used as a <a>subject complement</a>.</b>

<ul>
<li>Normal adjective: She is intelligent.</li>
(The normal adjective <i>intelligent</i> can be used after a linking verb (here, <i>is</i>) and function as a subject complement.)
<li>Determiner: She is [nothing fits here].</li>
(You can't use a determiner as a subject complement. NB: If you think you've found a determiner that fits, then you've found a pronoun not a determiner.)
</ul>

Below is a brief description of the main determiners. (There is a separate page on each one.)<br><br>

<b>Possessive Determiners</b>. The possessive determiners (called "possessive adjectives" in traditional grammar) are <i>my</i>, <i>your</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>their</i>, and <i>whose</i>. A possessive determiner sits before a noun (or a pronoun) to show who (or what) owns it.

<ul>
<li>When a man opens a car door for <span class="highlight">his</span> wife, it's either a new car or a new wife. (Prince Philip) </li>
<li>The only time a wife listens to <span class="highlight">her</span> husband is when he's asleep. (Cartoonist Chuck Jones) </li>
</ul>




<b>Demonstrative Determiners</b>. The demonstrative determiners (called "demonstrative adjectives" in traditional grammar) are <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>these</i>, and <i>those</i>. A demonstrative determiner makes a noun (or a pronoun) more specific by relating it to something previously mentioned or something being demonstrated.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">That</span> man's silence is wonderful to listen to. (Novelist Thomas Hardy) </li>
<li>Maybe <span class="highlight">this</span> world is another planet's hell. (Writer Aldous Huxley) </li>
</ul>



<b>Articles</b>. The articles are the words <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>. They are used to define whether something is specific or unspecific.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">The</span> poets are only <span class="highlight">the </span> interpreters of <span class="highlight">the</span> gods. (Philosopher Socrates) </li>
<li>I'm <span class="highlight">an</span> optimist - but <span class="highlight">an</span> optimist who carries <span class="highlight">a</span> raincoat. (Prime Minister Harold Wilson) </li>
</ul>


<b>Numbers (or Cardinal Numbers)</b>. The cardinal numbers are <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, etc. (as opposed by <i>first</i>, <i>second</i>, <i>third</i>, etc., which are known as ordinal numbers). Cardinal numbers are used to specify quantity. They are part of the group of determiners known as "quantifiers."

<ul>
<li>If <span class="highlight">two</span> wrongs don't make a right, try <span class="highlight">three</span> wrongs. (Canadian educator Laurence Peter) </li>
<li><span class="highlight">One</span> loyal friend is worth <span class="highlight">ten thousand</span> relatives. (Greek Tragedian Euripides) </li>
</ul>



<b>Indefinite Determiners</b>. The most common indefinite determiners (called "indefinite adjectives" in traditional grammar) are <i>no</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>many</i>, <i>few</i>, <i>several</i>, and <i>some</i>. Indefinite determiners modify nouns in a non-specific way usually relating to quantity. Like numbers, they are part of the group of determiners known as "quantifiers." 

<ul>
<li>If you live to be one hundred, you've got it made. Very <span class="highlight">few</span> people die past that age. (Comedian George Burns) </li>
<li>If this is coffee, please bring me <span class="highlight">some</span> tea; but if this is tea, please bring me <span class="highlight">some</span> coffee. (US President Abraham Lincoln) </li>
</ul>


<b>Interrogative Determiners</b>. The most common interrogative determiners (called "interrogative adjectives" in traditional grammar) are <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, and <i>whose</i>. They are used to ask questions.

<ul>
<li>If you decide that you're indecisive, <span class="highlight">which</span> one are you? </li>
<li><span class="highlight">What</span> hair colour do they put on bald person's driving licence? </li>
</ul>



<h2>Nouns Used as Adjectives</h2>
Many words that are usually nouns can function as adjectives. For example:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">autumn</span> colours</li>
<li><span class="highlight">boat</span> race</li>
<li><span class="highlight">computer</span> shop</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Devon</span> cream</li>
<li><span class="highlight">electricity</span> board</li>
<li><span class="highlight">fruit</span> fly</li>
</ul>

Here are some real-life examples:

<ul>
<li>Not all <span class="highlight">face</span> masks are created equal. (Entrepreneur Hannah Bronfman) </li>
<li>You cannot make a revolution with <span class="highlight">silk</span> gloves. (Premier Joseph Stalin) </li>
</ul>

When used like adjectives, nouns are known as <i>attributive nouns</i>.

<h2>Participles Used as Adjectives</h2>

Formed from a verb, a <a >participle</a> is a word that can be used as an adjective. There are two types of participle:

<ul>
<li>The <a >present participle</a> (ending -<i>ing</i>)</li>
<li>The <a>past participle</a> (usually ending -<i>ed</i>, -<i>d</i>, -<i>t</i>, -<i>en</i>, or -<i>n</i>)</li> 
</ul>

Here are some examples of participles as verbs:

<ul>
<li>The most <span class="highlight">exciting</span> phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not "Eureka!" but "That's funny." (Writer Isaac Asimov) </li>
<li>Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its <span class="highlight">operating</span> manual. (Author Terry Pratchett) </li>
<li>While the <span class="highlight">spoken</span> word can travel faster, you can't take it home in your hand. Only the <span class="highlight">written</span> word can be absorbed wholly at the convenience of the reader. (Educator Kingman Brewster) </li>
<li>We all have friends and <span class="highlight">loved</span> ones who say 60 is the new 30. No, it's the new 60. (Fashion model Iman) </li>
</ul>

A participle is classified as a <a >verbal</a> (a verb form that functions as a noun or an adjective).


<h2>Infinitives Used as Adjectives</h2>
An <a ../glossary/infinitive_form.htm">infinitive verb</a> (e.g., <i>to run</i>, <i>to jump</i>) can also function as an adjective. 

<ul>
<li>No human creature can give orders <span class="highlight">to love</span>. (French novelist George Sand)
(Here, the infinitive <i>to love</i> describes the noun <i>orders</i>.) </li>
<li>Progress is man's ability <span class="highlight">to complicate simplicity</span>. (Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl) </li>
(An infinitive will often head its own phrase. Here, the infinitive phrase <i>to complicate simplicity</i> describes the noun <i>ability</i>.)
</ul>


<h2>The Order of Adjectives</h2>
When two or more adjectives are strung together, they should be ordered according to the following list:


<table class="gridtable centerfirst">
<tbody><tr>
<th class="nostretch">Order</th>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Determiner</td><td>the, my, those</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Number</td><td>one, two, ninety-nine</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Opinion</td><td>lovely, attractive, rare</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Size</td><td>small, medium, large</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Physical Quality</td><td>thin, lumpy, cluttered</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shape</td><td>round, square, triangular</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Age</td><td>young, middle-aged, old</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Colour</td><td>red, white, blue</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Origin</td><td>British, German, Russian</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Material</td><td>wood, metal, plastic</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Type</td><td>L-shaped, two-sided, all-purpose </td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Purpose</td><td>cooking, supporting, tendering</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td class="nostretch">Attributive Noun</td><td>service, improvement, head</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Here is an example of a 14-adjective string (shaded) that is ordered correctly:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">my two lovely XL thin tubular new white Spanish metallic hinged correcting knee</span> braces.</li>
</ul>

Regardless of how many adjectives are used (more than 3 is rare), the established order is still followed.

<ul>
<li>That's <span class="highlight">a lovely, mixing</span> bowl</li>
(1: Determiner 2: Opinion 3: Purpose)

<li>Who's nicked my <span class="highlight">two black, wooden</span> spoons?</li>
(1: Number 2: Colour 3: Material)

<li>Give your ticket to <span class="highlight">the Italian old</span> waiter. </li>
(Age comes before origin. Therefore, <i>the old Italian waiter</i> would have been better.) 
</ul>

This list of precedence is not universally agreed, but all versions are pretty similar. The area of most dispute is age and shape. The order can change for emphasis too. If there were two old waiters, one Italian and one Spanish, then the wrong example above would be correct, and the word <i>Italian</i> would be emphasised. <br><br>

If you're a native English speaker, you are safe to ignore this list and let your instinct guide you. (You already know this stuff, even if you don't know you know it.) <br><br>



<h2>Compound Adjectives</h2>
Not all adjectives are single words...far from it. Often, a single adjective will comprise two or more words. A single adjective with more than one word is called a <a ../glossary/compound_adjectives.htm">compound adjective</a>. For example:

<ul>
<li>Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, <span class="highlight">close-knit</span> family in another city. (Comedian George Burns)</li>
<li>Be a <span class="highlight">good-looking</span> corpse. Leave a <span class="highlight">good-looking</span> tattoo. (Actor Ed Westwick)</li>
<li>I like the <span class="highlight">busted-nose</span> look. (Actor Peter Dinklage)</li>
</ul>

Compound adjectives are usually grouped with <a ../punctuation/using_hyphens.htm">hyphens</a> to show they are one adjective. <br><br>

<h2>Adjective Phrases</h2>
In real-life sentences, adjectives are often accompanied by <a ../glossary/modifiers_modify.htm">modifiers</a> like <a adverbs.htm">adverbs</a> (e.g., <i>very</i>, <i>extremely</i>) and <a ../glossary/prepositional_phrase.htm">prepositional phrases</a> (e.g., <i>...with me</i>, <i>...about the man</i>). In other words, an adjective (shown in bold) will often feature in an <i>adjective phrase</i> (shaded).

<ul>
<li>My bankers are <span class="highlight">very <b>happy</b> with me</span>. (The popstar formerly known as Prince)</li>
(In this example, the adjective phrase describes <i>bankers</i>.)

<li>The dragonfly is an <span class="highlight">exceptionally <b>beautiful</b></span> insect but a fierce carnivore.</li>
(Here, the adjective phrase describes <i>insect</i>.)
</ul>
Here's a more formal definition: 

<center>
<div class="sidelink" style="margin: 2em 0em; padding: 20px; max-width: 65%">
<center><b>Formal Definition for Adjective Phrase</b></center><br>
An adjective phrase is a group of words headed by an adjective that describes a noun.
</div>
</center>




<h2>Adjective Clauses</h2>
The last thing to say about adjectives is that clauses can also function as adjectives. With an adjective clause, the clause is linked to the noun being described with a relative pronoun (<i>who</i>, <i>whom</i>, <i>whose</i>, <i>that</i> or <i>which</i>) or a relative adverb (<i>when</i>, <i>where</i> or <i>why</i>). Like all clauses, it will have a subject and a verb.

<ul>
<li>The people <span class="highlight">who make history</span> are not the people <span class="highlight">who make it</span> but the people <span class="highlight">who make it and then write about it</span>. (Musician Julian Cope)</li><li>

</li><li>I live in that solitude <span class="highlight">which is painful in youth but delicious in the years of maturity</span>. (Physicist Albert Einstein)</li>
(It can start getting complicated. In the adjective clause above, <i>painful in youth</i> and <i>delicious in the years of maturity</i> are adjective phrases.)
</ul>
