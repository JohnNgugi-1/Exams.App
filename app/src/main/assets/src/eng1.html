<h2>Nouns</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea.<p>
 Everything we can see or talk about is represented by a word that names it. That "naming" word is called a noun.<p>
 Often a noun will be the name for something we can touch (e.g., lion, cake, computer), but sometimes a noun will be the name for something we cannot touch (e.g., bravery, mile, joy).<p>
 Easy Examples of Nouns<br/>
<b>People:</b> soldier, Alan, cousin, lawyer<br/>
<b>Animals:</b> aardvark, rat, shark, Mickey<br/>
<b>Places:</b> house, London, factory, shelter<br/>
<b>Things:</b> table, London Bridge, chisel, nitrogen, month, inch, cooking<br/>
<b>Ideas:</b> confusion, kindness, faith, Theory of Relativity, joy<p>

A noun can be categorized as either a common noun or a proper noun.<br/>
<b>Common Noun.</b> A common noun is the word used for a class of person, place, or thing (e.g., person, city, dog).<br/>
<b>Proper Noun.</b> A proper noun is the given name of a person, place, or thing, i.e., its own name (e.g., Michael, New York, Rover).<br/>
(Note: A proper noun always starts with a capital letter.)<p>
