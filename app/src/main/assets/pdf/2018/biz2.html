<b>1.	(a)Explain five circumstances that may lead to the existence of a business opportunity to be exploited by the entrepreneur.	(10 marks)</b><p>
	Lack of some products/services.<p>
Custoiners may need some products/services which are not easily found in their area.<p>
	Higher prices of goods/services.<p>
Existing market prices may be unnecessarily high hence offering them at relatively lower prices would create an opportunity.<p>
	Excess demand.<p>
When the quantities of goods available in the market are not sufficient, an opportunity to supply more exist.<p>
	Low quality products.<p>
When customers expect better quality products then, this presente an opportunity to offer them.<p>
	Sub-standard services.<p>
An opportunity will exist where better services are offered in the distribution of goods.<p>
	Un-met sociocultural needs/conditions.<p>
Goods and ses ices should target the society’s existing attitudes, practices and beliefs which existing products may not be addressing.<p>
	Innovation.<p>
Discovery of new technology which may lead to reduced costs of production and general efficiency presents an opportunity.<p>

 
<b>(b)	Explain five factors that Chuma Steel Manufacturers may consider when choosing a channel for distributing their products.	(10 marks)</b><p>

	The geographical spread of customers.<p>
If the customers are spread over a wide area, then a longer channel would be preferable.<p>
	Durability of the steel products.<p>
Since steel products are not easily spoilt, long channels can be used ln their distribution.
	Level of competition.<p>
Shorter channels should be used if competition is so stiff.<p>
	Resources and size of the firm.<p>
If the firm has limited resources and only serves a small market, then a shorter channel is ideal.<p>
	Government policy.<p>
Chuma steel manufacturers must adhere to government regulation on the distribution of steel products.<p>
	Marketing risks.<p>
Where marketing risks are higher, more middlemen should be involved to spread such risks.<p>
	Availability of intermediaries.<p>
Chuma Steel Manufacturers can only use channels where intermediaries are available.
	Pricing of the steel products.<p>
Shooter channels will be preferred where the prices are to be kept low by avoiding the intermediaries.<p>
