Vulcanicity leads to solidification of minerals in cracks and crevices.
Metamorphism lead to change into new mineral/formation of
minerals.
Leaching a weathering process results into concentration of minerals in the crust.
Erosion loosens minerals and transports them eventually depositing them as alluvial deposits.
Sedimentation deposits, accumulates and concentrates minerals in specific areas making them occur in layers, beds and seams.
	Evaporation enhances crystallization leading to formation of salts.
	Weathering exposes minerals near the earth’s surface.<p>

<b>(b)	Describe the open cast method of mining.(5 marks)</b><p>

 The crystals are crushed and mixed with Trona and liquor.
	A mixture of Trona and liquor is pumped through a pipeline to the soda ash factory.
Trona is separated from water by being put on large sieve like trays. The Trona is washed to remove mud and salt.
	After drying Trona is heated/roasted in big cylinders and it breaks into small particles of sodium carbonate/soda ash.
Soda ash is allowed to cool.
It is then ground, weighed and packed into paper bags ready for transportation to the market.<p>



<b>(d)	Explain three ways in which mining promotes industrialisation in Kenya.	(6 marks)</b><p>Some minerals provide essential raw materials for some manufacturing industries.
Minerals are exported to earn the country foreign exchange which is used for development of industries.
	Mining stimulates development of roads/railways which promotes industrial growth/eases movement of raw materials/finished products to industries.
	Mining attracts settlements leading to development of towns which attract industrial development.
	Mining creates employment raising the living standards of the people hence, creating a greater demand for industrial products thus promoting industrial

	Mining has stimulated growth of related industries that supply inputs/services.<p>



 
<b>8.	(a)	(i)	What is forestry?(2 marks)</b><p>

<b>(iii)	State the problems experienced in exploitation of tropical hardwood forests.(5 marks)</b><p>
Trees take long time to mature
Forests are dense/ thick.
Trees do not mature at different times making harvesting difficult and expensive.
The forest have mixed tree species making exploitation difficult and almost impossible.
Tree trunks are huge, supported by buttress roots/presence of tree climbers/lianas hence difficult to exploit.

There are many rivers with waterfalls suitable for generation of hydro- electric power for use in the industries.
	The low temperatures /cold climate in the highlands discourage settlement/agriculture leaving forestry as the only land use.
The landscape is rugged with thin soils that discourage agricultural/settlement activities therefore most of the mountain slopes are under forests.
Moderate to high precipitation throughout the year favours luxuriant growth of forests.
	Presence of rivers which provide cheap water transport to transport logs to factories/presence of snow facilitates easy movement of logs.

<b>9.	(a)	Explain each of the following methods of land rehabilitation:<p>

(i)	Mulching(4 marks)</b><p>
This is the use of crop residues such as vegetable remains, plant litter, and grass and polythene sheets to cover the soil/crop.
It helps to retain soil moisture, reduce soil erosion and reduce the splashing effect of rain water on soil.
	It increases water infiltration in to the soil by preventing it from surface runoff.
When the vegetative materials decompose it produces organic matter which increases the fertility of the soil.<p>

<b>(ii)	Bunds and gabions(6 marks)</b><p>
	Bunds are soil piles across a slope constructed to control soil erosion.
Bunds are also built to check surface runoff which would cause soil erosion/influence water infiltration.
Gabions are wire mesh that are filled with soil, stones and other materials.
Gabions are constructed on slopes/across gullies to trap soils being carried by running water down slope.
	Gabions encourage vegetation growth in the trapped soil.
Both are effective for controlling soil erosion/stabilizing slopes<p>

/the number of live births per thousand women of child bearing age in a given year.<p>

<b>(ii) Explain three factors that have contributed to the reduction in fertility rate in Kenya. (3 marks)</b><p>
	The cost of bringing up children has gone up therefore parents limit the number of children they can have.
	Increased use of birth control methods has lowered the number of children women get in their life time.
More girls are attending school/ are pursuing higher education and training. This makes them stay longer before getting married.
