 Bertolt Brecht, <i>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</i><br/> With illustrations from Bertolt Brecht’s, <i>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</i>, write a composition entitled: Self Centeredness Does Not Pay.<p>
<b> Introduction (2 marks)</b><p> Many people in society are motivated by self-interest. They think that in pursuing their interests they will achieve their goals and become happy. Such people think what they are doing is for the best, but eventually they become ultimate losers. This is the case in Bertolt Brecht’s <i>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</i>. (Accept any other relevant introduction) <p>
<b>Body</b><p>
 - In the play, George Abashwili is preoccupied with his own concerns and cares little about the wishes of his subject. For instance, he does not pay any attention to the petitioners who come to him on that fateful Easter Sunday. He is so preoccupied with trifles that he dismisses the messenger who would probably have communicated the threat to his position and life. Instead of sparing a moment to speak to him he indulges in selfish concerns. <p>
“Not before service, Shalva, but did you hear Brother Kazbek wish me a happy Easter? P. 16. By the end of the day George Abashwili loses not only his position but also his life. (pp. 3-16, 18-21, 26-28, 63)<p>
 - NatellaAbashwili does not consider the feelings of other people. She roughly orders her servants about and even abuses and beats one of them for no misdeed. When her husband is executed and they have to escape, she is so obsessed with which clothes to wear or take with her that she leaves her own baby behind! We only hear of her again after the war when she comes looking for the child because she now needs him in order to have access to her husband’s estate. Unfortunately for her, in the famous court case the baby is given to Grusha, the motherly woman who had risked her life and made sacrifices in order to protect and take care of the abandoned child. Natella ends up losing everything including her son and her late husband’s immense wealth, (pp. 18-19, 21-24, 27-28, 38, 69, 70-74, 82-83)<p>
 - The Fat prince executes his brother in order to gain power when civil war breaks out he too is beheaded. He ends up in the same way as his brother.<p>
 - Grusha’s mother-in-law and the Monk conspire to marry Grusha to the ‘dying’peasant for selfish gain. In the end, when the truth comes out, they lose their dignity.<p>
 - The princes mismanage the war in order to overthrow the Grand Duke’s government and take over the leadership. They succeeded in this but eventually they lose out when the Grand Duke comes back to power. (19, 70, 73-74, 82, 84, 89)<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p> People who  act out of selfishness assume that they  stand  to  gain  from their actions. However, whatever they think they have gained is soon lost because their evil actions eventually  catch  up  with  them.  (Accept any other valid  conclusion) Mark any 4  well developed points 3:3:3:3=12 marks; Grammar and presentation: 4 marks.<p>
<b>3.   THE OPTIONAL SET TEXTS</b><p>
<b>(a) The Short Story</b><p>
Chris Wanjala (Ed.), <i>Memories We Lost and Other Stories</i><br/> Drawing examples from Barry McKinley’s short story “Almost Home”, write a composition on the topic: “Some people keep making one bad decision after another.”<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
 As they say, choices have consequences. When we make one bad decision, it is likely to be followed by a series of other bad if not worse decisions. We see this happen in “Almost Home” by Barry McKinley.” (Accept any other relevant introduction)<p>
<b> Body </b><p>
 -  In the story, the first bad decision that Ali made was to go along with his family’s decision to send him to Ireland as an illegal immigrant. Once there, he leads a fake life by pretending to be a medical student. He lowers his dignity by living off handouts and sleeping on his benefactors’ sofas, (pp. 74, 75, 76) <p>
  -   To try and save him from that parasitic and miserable kind of life, a professor at Trinity College offers him 200 Euros to return home to Tangiers. Unfortunately, and ridiculously, he decides to buy an iPod which he never learnt to use. (p. 74) <p>
 - Yet another bad  decision  that All makes is to  squander his money  while in  Ireland. Although he gets several jobs, he doesn’t send any money back. He forgets the sacrifice his family had made to send him to Ireland. As a result, he feels he cannot face them when he is deported, (pp. 74, 76)<p>
 - He endangers his life needlessly when there is an attempt to deport him. He shouts that he is a terrorist and that he has a bomb with which he will blow up the plane. This was a great risk for he could easily have been eliminated by security officers. We also see him risk his 
 life when he makes a dash among moving vehicles, barely escaping being crushed by a trailer.<p>
 - Ali to a nearby table to a woman picking at her food and lies that he has been abducted and needs help, (p.75)<p>
  - The final and the worst decision that he makes is to commit suicide. He cannot contemplate how he will face his mother and sisters whom he has badly let down. He did not make anything of himself in Ireland and therefore did not improve the life of his family. He also dreads being  locked  up  and  the trouble his family  would  take to  bail him out. Consequently, he decides to plunge into the sea. (pp. 76, 78)<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p> Barry McKinley demonstrates that sometimes we fail to remedy an initial bad decision. Instead, we worsen the situation by making other related bad choices. This is what Ali does and he ends up dead. (Accept any other valid conclusion)<p>
 
<b>(b) Drama</b><p>
 Francis Imbuga, <i>Betrayal in the City</i><br/> There is a direct link  between  oppression  and  weaknesses in  a leader’s character.  Drawing examples form Francis Imbuga’s <i>Betrayal in the City</i>, write an essay illustrating the truth of this statement.<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p> In oppressive regimes there is often a direct link between oppression and the weaknesses in the leader’s character. For instance, an insecure leader tends to be oppressive because he or she doesn’t want to be challenged. In the play, Betrayal in the City, we see that Boss’s bad actions are consistent with his personality. The people of Kafira live in a state of fear and uncertainty because Boss wants to hold on power at whatever cost. (Accept any other relevant introduction)<p>
 <b>Body</b><p>
  - Many of the injustices in Kafira are attributable to Boss’s corrupt nature. Mulili, his cousin, has little education yet he has been appointed a senior government official. In the play, Mulili is Boss’s chief agent of oppression. Nina and Doga are denied the right to carry out final rites for their dead son. When Jere requests Mulili to allow them to carry on with the ceremony, he says he cannot allow it because his future depends on it. It happens that Boss has promised to give him a large farm and grade cattle (Pl3). By lavishing Mulili with gifts Boss spurs Mulili on towards more oppression of the people, (pp. 8-15, 59-60, 68)<p>
 - Tumbo tells Regina that Boss’s main fault lies in making hasty decisions and then standing by them. One instance when we see this is when Boss orders the execution of Kabito through an organised accident instigated by Mulili. Boss says that Kabito is one of his most loyal subjects yet he does not take time to investigate the wild allegations made by Mulili against Kabito. This is because of his rash nature. It is also rash to order for three hundred expatriates just to put students in their place. This is particularly so because such an action has serious repercussions on Kafira’s sovereignty and economy, (pp. 45, 58-60, 64, 65, 68)<p>
  - Boss is cruel. He presides over executions of anybody who dares to challenge his rule. The murder of Adika is planned. During the students’ demonstrations only four bullets were fired and Adika had four bullet wounds.Instead of addressing the issues raised by the striking students, Boss prefers to silence their student leader. When Boss decides to get rid of Kabito, he tells Mulili that he (Mulili) knows what must be done. Mulili quickly replies that he (Mulili)is an old hand at everything and reminds him about the old couple. It becomes apparent that it was Mulili who organized for Jasper’s parents to be murdered in cold blood so that Jasper would have no one to return to after being released from jail (P 20). Mulili is just doing these dirty jobs for Boss. (pp. 1-4, 20, 24, 33-35, 58-60, 62-63, 67)<p>
 - Boss is gullible. We find that he is easily influenced by his advisers, the chief one being Mulili. For some reasons not clear to us, Boss trusts Mulili completely. We would expect Mulili to be faithful after all the favours Boss has showed on him. However, Mulili takes advantage of this trust to misadvise Boss and to settle scores with those who differ with him. For instance, because he knows the boss well, he is able to fabricate a story to warrant Kabitos execution. Jere is also another victim of his vindictiveness. He is imprisoned unfairly,  most likely  on  framed  up  charges,  for disagreeing  with  Mulili over the cancellation of Adika’s final rites, (pp. 13-15, 22, 58-60, 62-63)<p>
 - Because of his fearful and insecure nature, Boss cannot put up with anyone who challenges or criticizes him. He orders Kabito’s execution because he is afraid that Kabito knows too much about him and might oppose him. Like Kabito, people who speak their minds are either arrested, imprisoned or simply executed. Mosese is arrested on fabricated charges for speaking out during Adika’s funeral. No one is safe because Boss has spies like Mulili, self seekers, who misreport events to gain political mileage. This results in oppression of those involved, (pp. 18, 19, 24, 25 44, 48, 58-60, 63)<p>
 - Tumbo says Boss has a weakness for women and Regina confirms it. She dreads going to see him over Mosese’s release. He locks his wife up. (pp. 45, 61)<p>
 <b>Conclusion</b><p> As we have seen in Betrayal in the City, this confirms what weak leaders in the world have done. Leaders like Bokassa, Idi Amin, Hitler and many others, illustrate this truth. (Accept any other valid  conclusion)<p>
<b>(c) The Novel</b><p>
John Steinbeck, <i>The Pearl</i><br/> With illustrations from John Steinbeck’s <i>The Pearl</i>,  write an essay showing the evil nature of greed.<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p> Greed, which springs from selfishness and self-centredness, destroys human relationships and often leads to death. Humans are social animals and were by nature meant to help one another and generally work for the good of society. John Steinbeck’s novella The Pearl demonstrates that greed destroys these human bonds. (Accept any other relevant introduction)<p>
 <b>Body</b><p>
 - Kino, the hero in The Pearl, gets what is later called the pearl of the world from the sea. It is not as if he has worked hard to get this object. But in his excitement, he tries to capitalize on this lucky find. This desire costs him a lot of suffering, (pp. 28-29, 37-38, 42-46, 47- 48, 50-56, 78-79, 83-115)<p>
 -  The entire neighbourhood hears of this great find, and they want either to lay their hands on it or somehow benefit from it. In other words, the great pearl unleashes the evil in these neighbours. Kino’s properties are destroyed by greedy neighbours - his house is burnt and his canoe is damaged. This is because of the pearl, (pp. 41-43, 45-47, 53, 55-56, 65-67, 69, 71-75, 83-92)<p>
 - The local doctor doesn’t want to treat Kino’s son who has been stung by a scorpion. But when he hears about the pearl, he comes and engages in medical malpractice in order to partake of the wealth that will accrue from the sale of the pearl, (pp. 27-29, 41-42, 50-53, 55-56)<p>
 - The pearl dealers offer Kino the bare minimum, 1,000 and later 1,500 pesos, pretending the pearl is of no great value. For his part, Kino wants 50,000 pesos, an indication of his greed. This means that the greed on both sides cannot allow them to agree on a price, (pp. 63-64, 69, 70-75)<p>
 - Kino is hurt in a fight with a man who tries to rob him of the pearl; but he eventually kills him. (pp. 17-19, 59-60, 83-85, 90, 92)<p>
 - Kino beats up his wife Juana, who tries to steal the pearl with the aim of throwing it back into the sea. Juana has rightly perceived that this pearl is the source of evil and suffering, (pp. 17-19, 59-60, 83-85)<p>
 - Kino  and  his family  try  to  flee to  the north,  but they  are pursued  by  trackers.  Kino ambushes them, snatches their rifle and kills them. In the struggle, his son Coyotito is killed, (pp. 92, 100-118)<p>
 - The death of his son is apparently a turning point. Husband and wife return to La Paz, and Kino throws the pearl, the symbol of evil and suffering, back into the sea. Life returns to normal and we are back where we began, (pp. 114-118)<p>
 - The priest on receiving news about Kino’s fortune quickly thinks of the gains he can make out of it. (pp. 41, 47-48)<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p> John Steinbeck shows definitively that greed brings out the worst in us. We kill each other because of this evil trait. We hurt even those we love because of greed. But the story of The Pearl also proves that we can overcome this dark side of our human nature. (Accept any other valid conclusion)<p>
