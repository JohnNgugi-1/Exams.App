<b>(b)	Explain the processes that take place in the regions labelled G and H. Region G(3 marks)</b><p>
At the (glomerulus), the afferent arteriole which brings blood to the glomerulus is wider than the efferent arteriole; this creates high pressure; leading to ultrafiltration;<p>
At the proximal convoluted tubule /dista1 convoluted tubule, substances required by the body/amino acid substances required by the body (amino acids/glucose/vitamins/ some water; are selectively re-absorbed (into the blood stream); hence selective reabsorption

<b>7.	(a)	Describe the mode of reproduction in a named fungus.(5 marks)</b><p>
Rhizopus/mucor/mould; reproduce asexually; by sporulation; spores develop from a single cell forming sporangium; which bursts on maturity releasing spores; which are dispersed by air currents/wind germinating; to form new generation/ form a mycelium (if it lands on a suitable medium); Or Yeast/Saccharomyces/Schizosaccharomyces; reproduce asexual1y;by budding; parent cell forms an outgrowth/projection/bud; this is followed by division of the nucleus into two; one of the nuclei moves into the bud; which grows and develops into a new cell;<p>

<b>(b)	Describe the role of hormones in the human menstrual cycle.
 (15 marks)</b><p>
After/at the onset of menstruation, (the anterior lobe of) the pituitary gland; secretes follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); the FSH causes the Graafian follicle; to develop into the ovary; and stimulate the OVary tlssues to secrete oestrogen hormone; Oestrogen brings about repair/healing of the endometrium/uterine wall; its concentration increases to a level which stimulates the (anterior) pituitary gland; to secrete lutenizing hormone (L.H.) and stops fiirther secretion of FSH;
The L.H. stimulates the maturation of the Graafian follicle; LH also stimulates the Graafian follicle to release an ovum into the (funnel of the) fallopian tube/causes ovulation; it also stimulates the remains of the Graafian follicle to form a yellow body/corpus luteum (in the ovary;
The corpus luteum is stimulated by the L.H. to produce progesterone; Progesterone then stimulates the thickening of the endometrium/inner lining of the uterine wall; in readiness for implantation; as progesterone level increases, it inhibits (the pituitary gland) from secreting FSH; further increase in progesterone level inhibits the pituitary gland from secreting L.H. This causes the corpus Luteum to degenerate; this reduces the amount of progesterone; the sudden drop in secretion of progesterone causes the endometrium to slough off/menstruation occurs; and the cycle is repeated<p>




<b>8.	Describe what happens to a meal rich in proteins along the alimentary canal from ingestion to egestion.	(20 marks)</b><p>


 	The meal is ingested through the mouth; (In the mouth), it is chewed/masttcated (by teeth); to reduce/break it into smaller particles; mixed with saliva (from salivary gland);
The food is then rolled (by the tongue) into boluses; and pushed down/ into the oesophaghus/swallowed; The boluses move by peristalsis (into the stomach);

Constant contractions/relaxations of the stomach walls mix the food, (giving rise to chime); Presence of food in the stomach further stimulates production of gastric juice; which contains pepsinogen; and rennin/chymosln; Pepsinogen is activated to pepsin; by hydrochloric acid; (contained in the gastric juice). Pepsin breaks down proteins to peptides;

Rennin converts/coagulates the protein, caseinogen; in milk to casein; (which is abundant in young children). It is then pushed into the duodenum (through the pyloric sphincter): Pancreatic juice in the duodenum contains trypsin; which digests proteins into peptides; (secreted in an inactive form, trypsinogen)	

	
In the ileum, intestinal juice/succus antericus iz secreted; It contains peptidase enzymes; which breaks down polypeptides into amino acids; It also contains polypeptidase enzyme; which breaks down peptides to amino acids, completing the process of digestion of the proteins;

The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream/pass through the epithelia of the villi, and the capillary walls into the blood-stream; by active transport; The undigested/indigestible proteins/food substances pass through to the colon/large intestlnes; where water is absorbed; leaving a semi-solid waste material being passed on to the rectum; then out through the anus (as faeces);	<p>
