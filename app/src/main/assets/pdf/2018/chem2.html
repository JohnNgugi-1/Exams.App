<b>(iii)	Write the formula of the compound formed when L and I react.(1 marks)</b><p>
Across the period, size of atoms decreases therefore more energy required to remove
electrons from an atom i<p>n its gaseous state hence, 1ˢᵗ ionization energy for M will be greater than that of K. <p>
K has lower nuclear charge / attraction than M / K has less protons than M. <p>

<b>(iv)	Give one use of element V.(1 marks)</b><p>

<b>(c)	(i)	State another group that G can be placcd in Figure 1. Explain.

Group 7. <p>Because G can either lose an electron to form G“ or gain an electron to
form G. <p>


<b>(ii)	How do the reactivity of elements J and K compare? Explain.	(2 marks)</b><p>
I is more reactive than K because of increase in the size of atoms. As we go down the group, the atoms increase in size so does reactivity. Outer electrons do not experience much nuclear attraction for bigger atoms.<p>

OR<p>
Reactivity increases down the group, effective nuclear attraction is greater in K than I' atomic radius of I is greater than that of K.<p>
