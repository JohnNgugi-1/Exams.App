<b>A POISON TREE</b><p>
I was angry with my friend;<p>
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<p>
I was angry with my foe:<p>
I told it not, my wrath did grow.<p>

And I watered it in fears, Night and morning with tears; And 1 sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles.<p>

And it grew both day and night.<p>
Till it bore an apple bright. And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine.<p>
And into my garden stole,
when the night had veiled the pole;
in the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.<p>
