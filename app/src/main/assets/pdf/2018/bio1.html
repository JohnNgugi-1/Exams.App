<img src="b27.jpg" ><p>
From the graph explain why the mouse has a higher breathing rate than the elephant.(3 marks)</b><p>
Mouse is active/has a large surface area to volume ratio; hence has a higher metabolic rate (rate of breathing) to cope with the rate at which energy (oxygen) is consumed or lost to the environment; an elephant is less active/has a small surface area to volume ratio hence has a lower rate at which energy (oxygen) is used or lost; or
Mouse is small in size/has large surface area to volume ratio; hence has a metabolic rate (rate of breathing) to cope with the rate at which oxygen is consumed/energy is lost to the environment; an elephant is large in size/has small surface area to volume ratio; hence has a lower rate at which oxygen/energy is lost;<p>
