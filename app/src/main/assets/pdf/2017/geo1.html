(4 marks)</b><p> 
- The convectional currents in the mantle move horizontally.<p>- Their movement causes frictional drag on crystal rocks making them move along.<p>- The continents are dragged towards each other.<p> - This causes the sediments in the ocean and continents to be squeezed to form Fold Mountains.<p>
<b>(c) Explain four effects of folding on physical environment. (8 marks)</b> <p>
 - Fold Mountains receive heavy rainfall which give rise to rivers.<p>- Fold Mountains cause heavy rainfall in the windward slopes and little rainfall on the leeward slopes.<p> - The heavy rainfall on the windward side leads to growth of thick forests.<p> - The process of folding created crustal weakness which triggered off volcanic activities.<p> - In the mountainous regions, the cold wind descend to the lowland and valleys causing frost/temperature inversion.<p>- In the Northern Hemisphere, the south facing slopes are warmer than the north facing slopes.<p>- Folding leads to formation of different relief features/rugged landscape/ fold mountains. <p>

<b>9. (a) (i) Define the term hydrological cycle. (2 marks)</b><p>

<b> (ii) Give three factors that influence the occurrence of surface runoff. (3 marks)</b> <p>- The amount of rainfall<p>- The gradient of the land<p>- The nature of the rocks/soil<p>- The water table<p> - Vegetation <p>
<b>(iii) State the significance of the hydrological cycle. (4 marks)</b><p>
cycle Evapotranspiration increases water in the atmosphere It helps to regulate the surface water/underground water and water in the atmosphere.<p>- It provides underground water through percolation.<p>- Large rivers drain into oceans and lakes to form water bodies.<p>- Water evaporates from the ground causing drying up of water bodies/arid conditions. It controls the elements of weather such as temperatures/ • humidity and rainfall.<p>- Water vapour maintains the heat energy in the atmosphere Moisture in the atmosphere influences both solar! terrestrial radiation. <p>
<b> (b) Describe how the following lakes were formed. (i) moraine dammed lake (2 marks)</b> <p>- It is formed when the valley glacier melts and moraine is deposited across the glacial troughs.<p>- The moraine forms a barrier and melt water collects behind it to form a moraine dammed lake.<p>- The water accumulates to form a moraine dammed lake.<p>
<b>(ii) oxbow lake (4 marks)</b><p>- A meandering river erodes the outer bank of a meander and deposits material in the inner river bank.<p>- This deposition continues until a narrow piece of land is left separating the two bends.<p>- This is eventually eroded by floods forcing the river to flow on a straight channel.<p>- A loop of the meander is abandoned to form an oxbow lake<p>
<b> (c) Explain ways in which lakes modify the climate of the surrounding areas. (6 marks)</b><p> - The lake breezes have a cooling effect on the surrounding area' warming effect on land during the cold season.<p> - High rate of evaporation from the lake leads to the formation of convectional rainfall on the land.<p> - Evaporation from the lakes increases moisture in the atmosphere leading to increase in humidity. (Lake and land breezes help moderate the temperature of the surrounding areas).<p> - These breezes may strengthen or divert the prevailing winds.<p>- The lake influences the occurrence of local winds/land &lake breezes<p>
<b>(d) Give four reasons why some lakes have fresh water. (4 marks) </b><p>
- They are fed by rivers/have inflow which dilutes the salts.<p> - The bedrocks contain mineral salt/ salt minerals.<p>- The bedrock do not contain saline rocks.<p> - They have surface outlets which carries away salts.<p>- They have underground outlets which drains accumulated salts.<p> - They are situated in areas of high rainfall.<p> - Some art found in areas of low temperatures therefore have <p>
<b>10. (a) (i) What is soil structure? (2 marks) </b><p>
- Soil structure is the way the individual soil particles are arranged into aggregate compound particles. <p>
<b>(ii) Explain how the following factors influence soil formation. <p>• Time (2 marks)</b><p>Where soil formation process takes a short duration, the soils are generally immature/where the process has taken a long period of time, soils are generally well developed/ mature. <p>
<b> <p>• Parent rock (4 marks)</b><p>
- The nature of rock influences the rate of weathering in that soft rocks weather fast, while hard rocks are resistant and weather slowly.<p>- The parent rock determines the soil texture in that, large/ course grained rocks produce large/course grained soils/ small/ fine grained rocks produce small fine grained soils..<p>- The type of minerals in the parent rock are transferred to the soil during formation.<p>
<b>(b) Describe the following properties of soil.</b><p> <b>Soil texture (2 marks)</b>
 <p>- This is the degree of fineness or coarseness of the particles making up the soil. It is the size of the soil particles.<p> - The texture controls the size and spacing of the soil pores. This effects the soil water content/the drainage/leaching/soil aeration <p>
<b> Soil porosity (2 marks)</b><p>- This is the amount of pore spaces in the soil. The size of the pore spaces determine the water flowing in the soil/ sandy soils have high porosity hence allow water to pass through. Clay soils have few pores hence retain water.<p>
<b>Soil colour (2 marks) </b><p>
- The soil have different colours influenced by parent rock/ vegetation leaching processes. Black/dark brown soils denote a lot of humus. - Grey soils are characteristics of poorly drained/water logged soils. Whitish soils show high concentration of salts. - Reddish soils have high concentration of iron<p>
<b>(c) State four negative effects of soil erosion. (4 marks)</b><p> 
- This is the degree of fineness or coarseness of the particles making up the soil.<p>- It causes uprooting/blowing away of plants/plants are washed away/buried. - It can cause destruction of buildings/bridges.<p>- Gully erosion exposes underground water lowering the water table.<p>- It leads to destruction of vegetation cover which can cause desertification.<p>- It causes deposition of sediments into water reservoirs.<p> - Contaminated sediments deposited into water bodies lead to water pollution, Sediments brought by water erosion to the beaches may make them muddy.<p>- It causes land dereliction<p>

You are planning to carry out a field study on soil around your school.<p> (i) State four preparations that you will make for the study.<p>- Setting up objectives/hypothesis Getting permission from the school authority.<p>- Making reconnaissance/pre-visit Assembling various tools/equipment to use.<p>- Preparing a working schedule.<p> - Identifying methods of data collection.<p>- Literaturc review <p>
