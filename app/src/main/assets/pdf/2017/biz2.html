<b>(b). Explain ﬁve disadvantages of using direct taxes to raise government revenue.
(10 marks)</b><p><li>The burden of paying this tax is borne directly by the individual taxpayer and is paid at once or even in advance.<li> Gives the taxpayer motivation to evade tax payment- The tax paye may come up with ways of concealing their income in order to avoid paying the tax or reduce the amount to be paid.<li> Non-consultation of taxpayers in the determination of the tax rate - The determination of the rate and amount of tax to be paid is at the discretion of the tax authorities.<li> Not an adequate source of government revenue - Most people in developing countries are low income earners hence limiting the amount of tax revenue from this source.<li> Reduced ability to save and invest - Direct taxes take away money from the citizens hence reducing their purchasing power causing low investments.<li> Tax payers are not involved in the expenditure of the tax revenue.<li> There is low civic involvement and call for government accountability since tax payers do not make decisions on government expenditure.<li> May encourage capital ﬂight - Foreign investors may conceal their proﬁts in order to transfer such earnings to other countries.<p>

Final price is usually affected by market forces.<p><li> Difficulty in deciding on the value to use when making records - The values keep changing in line with market forces.<p><li> It is difﬁcult to determine the value of depreciation hence failure to record accurately the value of capital goods.<p>
<b>(b).Explain ﬁve circumstances under which a country may realise surplus in its balance of
payments. (10 marks)</b><p><li>When the country exports highly valued ﬁnished products - The demand for such products is high and they fetch higher prices in the international market.<p><li> When the country mainly imports lowly valued primary goods - These cheap imports are converted into ﬁnished goods hence earning proﬁts from international trade.<p><li> When the country aggressively promotes its exports - This will create more market for exporting goods thus increasing the count1y’s earnings.<p> <li> When the country devalues its currency - This makes imports more expensive forcing local consumers to by locally produced goods while exports become cheaper and are sold in large volumes.<p><li> When the country enjoys favourable economic order - The country may be able to inﬂuence the World market prices to favour its exports <p><li>When the country diversiﬁes its exports - The country increases the range of its exports hence becoming more competitive <p><li> When the country has access to adequate capital and technology - This makes the country to have a highly developed manufacturing and processing sector.<p>
<b>6.(a).Explain ﬁve methods that the government may use to increase supply of goods in the
market.( 10 marks)</b><p><li> Reduce the taxes levied on producers - This causes a reduction in the cost of production hence motivating producers to increase production.<p> <li> Increase subsidies - The govermnent meets part of the production cost hence making production more affordable.<p><li> Eliminating quotas on production - By not limiting the quantity of goods to be produced, the producers are free to supply as much as they can to the market.<p> <li> Setting favourable producer prices - The government ﬁxes the prices at a high level which encourages emergence of new producers/ expansion of existing ones.<p><li> Improving access to credit - The government extends loans to producers through bodies like K.I.E., IDB and ICDC to boost investment in production.<p> <li> Facilitating marketing - The government may form agencies that buy produce to cushion producers and stabilize selling prices e.g. through NCPB <li> Availing new research ﬁndings and technology to producers - New methods of production from government research bodies like KARI<p>
