(ii) Name the likely part of the human alimentary canal where the process in this experiment occurs. (1 mark) 
(iii) Give a reason for your answer in e (ii) above. (1 mark) <p> 

3. You are provided with specimens labelled H and K. Specimen H is a complete plant while J is a portion of a different plant. Observe the specimens and answer the questions that follow. <p> 
(a) State three observable differences between the leaves of specimens H and K. (3 marks) <p> 
(b) (i) Explain three ways in which the stem of specimen H adapts the plant for maximum photosynthesis. (3 marks) <p> 
(ii) Explain three ways in which the plant from which specimen K was obtained is adapted for survival in its habitat. (3 marks) <p> 

(c) Explain the consequence of adding liquid F used in question 1 to the soil in which specimen H is growing. (2 marks)<p> 

(d) State two ecological importance of specimen K in an ecosystem. (2 marks)<p>

<b>1.<p> a).i)</b><p> E - strips curved outwards; (1 mark) <br>F — strips curved inwards; (1 mark)<p> 
<b>ii)</b> E — Liquid Elwater entered inner cells/mesocarp of banana peels by osmosis; the inner cells expanded faster/enlarged more/became longer/ became turgid than the outer cells; (leading to the curvature outwards/outer cells did not expand); (3 marks)<p> 
F — (More) water left inner cells/moved out (of banana peels) into liquid F (by osmosis); inner cells shrunk/became flaccid/shorter (causing inward curvature); 
(2 marks) <p>
<b>b) </b>Liquid E has more solvent molecules/fewer solute molecules/ hypotonic(compared to the sap in the banana peel); while liquid F is hypertonic/ has more solute molecules/fewer solvent molecules/more concentrated/highly concentrated. (2 marks) <p> 
<b>c) </b>Outer surface(of the banana peel) is impermeable/less permeable/water-proof hence water enters or leaves only from the inner surface/while inner surface is permeable/more permeable; (1 mark) <p>
<b>d)  i)</b> Cell membrane/plasma membrane/plasmalemma; (1 mark)<p> 
<b>ii)</b> It is semi-permeable/selectively permeable; thus allowing (selective) movement of materials in and out of the cell/has pores which allow small molecules to pass through; (2 marks)<p>
<b>2 <p>a)</b> i) Contents of test tube A are clearer/colourless/form a solution; (1 mark) <p>
Contents of test tube B are cloudy/turbid/form a white precipitate/ suspension/milk/colloidal suspension; (I mark) <p>
<b>ii)</b> NaOH provided an alkaline medium/condition/optimum/best/suitable (in test tube A); suitable for action/working of enzyme P (on egg albumen); effectively digesting the egg albumen/protein; 
(3 marks) <p>
Contents of test tube B remained cloudy) Hydrochloric acid provided unsuitable/ acidic/unfavourable medium; for the working of enzyme P, hence no break down/ digestion of albumen occurred; (2 marks)<p>
<b> b)</b> To provide suitable/optimum/favourable/best temperature for the working/action of enzyme P; (1 mark)<p>
<b> d)</b> Control experiment; (1 mark) <p>
