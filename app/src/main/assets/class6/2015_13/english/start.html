<b>Read the passage below carefully and use it to answer questions 31 to 40. </b>
<p>On account of her beautiful face. Amuma was called 'Lightning‚Äô. Naturally, many young men wanted her as a wife, but she refused to marry any of them. Then came the festival of the village. Three young men appeared in the village, and as soon as Amuma saw them, she said : </p>
<p>‚ÄúIf it were possible for three men to marry one woman 1 would not hesitate at all. I would follow the three of them.‚Äù Everyone told her that she was mad. Could she not see that these were not men but fish? But Amuma insisted. </p>
<p>‚ÄúI do not care what they are. I shall marry all three of them!‚Äù Her mother was worried about this decision, and she approached the three strangers and told them what her daughter thought of them. </p>
<p>‚ÄúThe best solution is this: when you get out of the village you must light among yourselves, and let the victor carry off the prize. But as for stopping Amuma from getting what she desires 1 cannot do that.‚Äù </p>
<p>After the feast the strangers left the village with Amuma. As soon as they were out of sight, they changed into fish; Asa. Igbenu and Okpo. An argument arose at once as to who should lead Amuma to his home. Amuma was delighted to see the strangers <u>squabbling</u> over her and she began to sing. She told them that she had overheard her mother advising them. Could they not fight? She was prepared to marry the victor.</p> 
<p>With this encouragement. Igbenu and Asa rushed at each other. They lashed at each other with their tails and spat water into each other's eyes. It was a brief fight. Asa had no chance against the spines on Igbenu's forehead and back. </p>
 <p>when Asa was quite dead she began to sing in such a way that Okpo was 
inspired. Igbenu was still panting from his exertions when Okpo attacked him. <u>They were well matched</u> 
Okpo had no projecting spines, but along his entire back was a large fin from which the bones projected as in a comb. They fought for a long time, stopping now and again to swell with pride for the benefit of Amuma. </p>
<p>In the end Okpo won. </p>
<p>He led Amuma to the river, and there she lived as his wife.</p>

<p>Pesticides arc chemical compounds used mostly by farmers to kill pests such as insects, plant micro¬≠organisms and weeds that attack crops, food and livestock. These chemical compounds have, however, in the past proven to be <u>hazardous</u> not only to our health but to our environment as well. </p>
<p>When pesticides are used, some of the chemicals end up drifting away beyond the intended target to other destinations including water, air. soil and non-target species, causing pollution and endangering life. As much as the problem of pesticides is felt across the globe, developing nations face more difficulty when dealing with its consequences. Researchers have in fact, found that the use of pesticides in African countries, most of which largely depend on agriculture, causes more serious environmental and health problems than elsewhere in the world. </p>
<p>Kenya is one of the regions that heavily rely on agriculture and thus the use of pesticides in the country is rampant. Most farmers in Kenya use these chemicals and in large proportions, which has raised a number of 
environmental concerns. Pesticides are one of the main causes of water pollution which poses a major risk to humans and animals. Recently, some residents of Makueni county were admitted to hospital after consuming water suspected to have been laced with Triatix, a pesticides. </p>
<p>Besides water, pesticides also contaminate air and soil. Other effects include lowered nitrogen fixation process, destruction of habitat for organisms and the weakening of endangered species. </p>
<p>To decrease dependence of these chemicals, several nations have established strict guidelines and laws of manufacturing, registering and using pesticides. These rules have seen the cost of pesticides rise and their accessibility limited. </p>
<p>Other measures that can be taken by governments include eliminating synthetic pesticides and developing safer and eco-friendly bio-pesticides as well as improving technologies that promote better and safer application.</p>
